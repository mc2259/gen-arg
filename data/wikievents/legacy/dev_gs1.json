This move will also enhance the network-centric warfare capabilities of the Indian Navy's more than 100 surface ships and submarines. Sources from the  Indian Navy  said the cyber team's mission also includes attacking enemy networks, but did not disclose further details. The establishment of the Indian Navy's cyber team became a top priority after the computers of India's Eastern Fleet were attacked earlier this year.  Navy The first batch of IT officers will be selected from college graduates in fields such as IT, computer science and engineering, and they will be admitted to the Naval Academy in Ahimara from December this year, Navy officials said Commencement of 22 weeks of training.  Cyber \u200b\u200bOfficers will be  deployed on approximately 100  naval platforms, along with new aircraft carriers, frigates, nuclear-powered and conventionally-powered submarines Being introduced into the Indian Navy, the network-centric warfare capabilities of the Indian Navy will be enhanced.  The Indian Navy  is about to  launch  the long-delayed  multi-band geostationary orbit surveillance communication satellite , and the potential of naval network-centric warfare will also be amplified. The satellite will bring maritime domain awareness to the Navy through high-speed data links and will operate in conjunction with surface, subsea and air platforms of the  Indian Navy  as well as shore-based operations centres.",

Each project will maximize the use of existing commercial products and services. Hawkeye has been built and is expected to launch in 2013; Snapshot will also launch in 2013. The total cost to build the Hawkeye is $1.5 million.  The Army  hopes to use commercial-grade materials instead of aerospace-grade materials, bringing the cost of the sword down to $1.8 million per launch, including range fees. Operable on virtually any concrete road, the  Mobile Launcher  can also be transported using a C-130 transport aircraft.",

The system can be loaded into a mobile trailer, allowing military and civilian aircraft to safely land in almost any location in adverse weather conditions. Utilizing civilian TLS transponder landing system technology, the  Firefly System  provides precise tracking and guidance through interrogation of radar beacon transponders within the aircraft. It requires no new avionics and can be fully deployed by three military personnel in six hours. Unlike traditional instrument landing systems, the  Firefly system  has no requirements for the terrain in front of the runway, so a temporary airport can be established anywhere.  The Firefly system  will be installed on the rear of the C-130 Hercules.  ANPC 's Director of New Business Development said,  Firefly sets a new standard in air force safety, with the system adapting to uneven and mountainous terrain to enable precise approach to aircraft anywhere . After detailed  testing and evaluation by the  FAA  and  ANPC , the system received type certification from the FAA in December 2001, which will prove that the system is The technical and operational aspects can serve as a national space system.",

A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense said that the radar system can detect mortar shells launched by the enemy and quickly calculate the origin of the mortar shells launched by the enemy, allowing friendly forces to respond appropriately. The Ministry of Defense spokesman added that it would be up to the  Ukrainian Army  to decide how, when and where to deploy the radar system. At the same time, it will also depend on Ukraine whether these radar systems will be installed in the firing system to attack the turrets, or whether they will be used independently. The radar system is part of a U.S. commitment to provide equipment and training worth approximately $118 million to  the Ukrainian military .",

This system will connect a propulsion motor to the main reduction gearbox of the ship to provide propulsion power when the ship's speed is less than 13 knots. It is expected that a single ship can save thousands of barrels of fuel every year. In 2012, the  U.S. Navy  awarded  L-3 Company  a $50 million electromechanical hybrid propulsion research and development contract. The company  earlier this year   delivered  two  electromechanical hybrid system prototypes  for trial  testing  and is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2016 First shipment in the fourth quarter. Previously,  The British Royal Navy  also  applied  the  electromechanical hybrid system  on its  Type 23 frigate  . The DDG-51 class destroyer uses the LM-2500 gas turbine. Although the ship is more efficient when sailing at high speeds, it is inefficient when cruising at low speeds and wastes fuel. Maritime Systems Command said that when a ship is deployed, using the  electromechanical hybrid system  half of the time can extend the refueling interval by 2.5 days. The U.S. Sea Systems Command began studying electromechanical hybrid propulsion concepts in 2008, when military fuel prices reached $174/barrel. Before 2012,  The U.S. Navy  awarded a contract to General Atomics to develop a  electromechanical hybrid propulsion system  on the DDG-103 destroyer, using permanent magnet propulsion motors from DRS.  The U.S. Navy will equip two  DDG-51 Class IIA destroyers in the  fiscal year 2016   Outfitting, followed by Outfitting is completed at a rate of 4 ships per year.",

It can use lasers to collect distance data of other objects in space and has optical calibration functions. In this mission, AEHF-6 serves as the anchor satellite, and the  TDO-2  payload is integrated into the rear of the Centaur rocket's upper stage and will be first  deployed  . This will be the second time the U.S. military has carried out a ride-sharing launch in a national security space launch mission. The TDO-2 program will demonstrate  verification  payload replacement capabilities late in the integration effort, allowing  the Space Force  to replace payloads up to one month before launch.  The Space Force  believes this operation allows for greater flexibility in deploying national security payloads.",

Our enemies will use cyber activities to target U.S. soldiers, and the destruction of commercial and government infrastructure will also be very serious. On November 5, during a media conference at the Pentagon, the chief of the National Guard mentioned the Guard\u2019s cyber mission and capabilities and noted that cyber attacks have occurred at the federal and state levels.  Earlier this year, several  schools and  institutions in  Louisiana and  Texas   suffered  a ransomware attack. Ransomware is a type of malware designed to block access to a computer system until a ransom is paid. The Illinois State Guard is forming a cyber task force to assist Illinois if needed, the National Guard chief said. The Illinois task force will be composed of Guard Soldiers and Airmen who perform cyber, information technology and other military functions. Indiana recently established a cyber battalion where soldiers will receive military-standard training to prepare for domestic cyber operations capabilities. The National Guard chief said the cyber mission force would become part of the Army's combat mission, which could be federalized and conduct cyber activities for the U.S. Army or U.S. Cyber \u200b\u200bCommand.",

In May 2016, Spanish Navantia Shipbuilding Company won a contract to build two supply-class supply ships for the  Australian Navy  to replace the upcoming supply ships Success and Sirius. After commissioning, the lead ship  Supply will be  deployed at  Australian Navy Eastern Fleet Base Sydney, while its sister ship  Starwater USS will be  deployed at  Western Fleet Base Sterling. Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton said that auxiliary refueling and supply ships are a key element of the country's modern maritime operations. As regional security challenges intensify, strong maritime business support capabilities are more important than ever. The supply class will help maintain Australia's strong naval capabilities and safeguard the security, sovereignty and prosperity of Australia and its regional partners.",

The ARSR-4 radar will provide improved location information and weather detection, thereby improving U.S. military air safety. The route surveillance radar is an all-solid-state, long-range, three-dimensional radar. It will replace existing legacy radars and provide weather data to the  FAA  , the U.S. Air Force, Navy and U.S. Customs. The ARSR-4 radar, produced by Northrop Grumman, provides many capabilities that other long-range radars do not have. It can detect targets with an area of \u200b\u200b1 square meter 250 nautical miles away, which is 50 nautical miles farther than ordinary long-range radars. The radar can also detect targets with an area of \u200b\u200b1 square meter under many harsh conditions. The superior target detection capability enables it to identify enemy intrusions and drug smuggling. Due to the added weather processing function, it can improve weather detection from Level 2 to Level 6. The meteorological information provided will give controllers and pilots greater understanding of the operating environment. The 43  operating systems in the plan are  deployed in  the surrounding continents of the United States,  Guam,  Hawaii Island and  Guantaramo Bay,  Cuba. The 44th system is used by the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City.",

Johnson said: In the  Navy's shipbuilding plan in the next 30 years, three  Joint High Speed \u200b\u200bShips will be purchased, but we believe that we will need more such ships in the future. . This ship is especially useful for the Marine Corps.

The base is located in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. There will be 400 to 500  French navy, army, and air force personnel   stationed here. The base can effectively control the connection to the Persian Gulf. and the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf of Oman. Previously, only the United States had built  military bases in oil-rich areas. However, as the United States' influence in Arab countries declines year by year, the Persian Gulf government is considering introducing other military cooperation in the region in the next few years. partner. According to relevant data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, an average of 15 oil tankers carrying 16.5 to 17 million barrels of crude oil pass through the strait every day. This is 40% of the world's daily shipping oil shipments and 20% of the world's daily crude oil shipments. In the  coming weeks,  France's  military base will soon begin  stationing the first batch of  warships and will become one of the key supporting forces in the fight against Somali piracy as an international naval force. Relevant Arab experts believe that the French  military base  will bring more balance to the region, improve the deterrence of Arab Gulf countries against Iran and bring stability to the region in the days to come.",

Deploy to  Guam and deploy 600 personnel to establish the Army Aviation and Missile Defense Task Force. The plan is to be completed in 2020 and is expected to cost about US$13 billion, of which Japan will bear US$6 billion under a price-sharing agreement.",

At this week's air show in Farnborough, England, the United States announced the successful test of a  laser weapon system  off the  California coast  . The technology, developed with Raytheon, uses just regular  industrial lasers  . \"Scientific American\" magazine commented on this technology and said that compared to Raytheon's earlier experiments that used static targets as targets, the technology for shooting down drones on surface platforms is more advanced. Raytheon's Mike Bowen told a reporter from USA Today: This is an important day for  laser weapons , but it is a disastrous day for drones. However,  laser weapon systems  will not be  deployed  anytime soon. Even if the next few  tests  are successful, it will be several years before this technology can be used in actual combat",

The feasibility of reducing the thickness of composite blades and fan casings is currently being investigated. Internal analysis determined that the current design based on the GEnx series scaled technology is sufficient to meet the bird impact and blade fly-out tests required for certification. By using composite materials instead of metal materials, the total weight of the 18-blade Leap-X fan is reduced by approximately 76kg. To increase its strength,  CFM  also needed to change its production process. GEnx blades still use the popular double-layer stacking process. Leap-X uses a three-dimensional braided resin conversion molding process to enhance its strength.  CFM  is building a  eCore2 demonstrator  to  test   Leap-X engine  components. Compared with the eCore1 test device, the high-pressure turbine of the new demonstrator has an additional stage. The first low-pressure and high-pressure biaxial joint test will begin at the end of  this year . Snecma has begun durability  testing  of the 180cm  diameter fan  developed from the Mascot project.",

The company's  new beam director  design underwent its first  test firing  on an Army system. Offensive laser weapons used to shoot down enemy aircraft must have a longer range strike capability. In addition to output power, they also place higher requirements on the precise direction of the laser beam. The laser beam needs to be accurately maintained at the exact same position. This causes the laser beam to heat the target and destroy it quickly. This work relies on the  beam guide. It first extracts sensor data on the current position of the target and shooting platform, uses advanced software to accurately predict where the beam needs to reach, and adjusts the specially designed reflector to make the laser To reflect in the right direction, the  beam director must be calculated and adjusted many times per second.  Lockheed Martin   completed 62 flights over the  past eight years   testing to optimize laser focus and stability while establishing A new Directed Energy Systems Integration Laboratory. The lab will test a 50kW laser next year and a 150kW laser by 2024.

AN/SPY-61 radar arrived at the  Naval Combat Systems Engineering Development Station in  Morristown, New Jersey for  testing . The Combat Systems Engineering Development Station, also known as the cruiser in the wheat field, has served as a ground test station for the Aegis combat system since 1977. Radar array testing will ensure that the software and hardware achieve the expected results according to the specifications. Testing the  SPY-6 radar  in a controlled environment on the ground will allow Aegis to troubleshoot and correct problems in a timely manner before the radar is deployed on ships. The new radar will replace the Lockheed Martin AN/SPY-1D radar.  The U.S. Navy will equip the  Arleigh Burke-class III destroyer   with   SPY-6 radar developed by Raytheon Company , and is planned to  2024   equip the first ship  Lucas being built at Ingalls Shipyard.",

Production of the forward fuselage will take place at the St. Louis plant, beginning just in time for the scheduled completion of the initial design review. The initial design review was followed by a critical design review in April 2005. Northrop Grumman began production of the center/rear fuselage at its El Segundo plant in July. A test aircraft of the EA-18G is named  EA-1  and is planned to be assembled at the St. Louis factory of  Boeing Company  and will be launched in  September 2006  First flight. The EA-18G is derived from the F/A-18F Super Hornet strike fighter and will be used to replace the aging EA-6B aircraft.  The U.S. Air Force  has begun flight testing of an improved  Theater Airborne Reconnaissance System  that includes Lockheed Martin's synthetic aperture radar. The first  test  of the system was conducted at  Edwards Air Force Base  using a  F-16 aircraft  and was successful. The government-funded trial will continue until next spring. The addition of synthetic aperture radar to BAE Systems' theater airborne reconnaissance system is expected to enable the pod to operate in severe weather.",

On August 11th  ,  Pakistan's military  announced that Pakistan successfully  test-fired  its first self-developed cruise missile that day. Major General Sultan, spokesman of the Pakistani military, said that the land-based cruise missile named  Babur has a range of 500 kilometers, can carry nuclear warheads, and can fly close to the ground, so it has a strong Guard against radar surveillance capabilities. Regarding the agreement between  India and Pakistan  last week to provide advance notice to each other of  missile   tests, Major General Sultan pointed out , since the agreement limits ballistic missiles, the cruise missiles tested this time are not restricted by the agreement, so there is no need to notify India in advance. Pakistani officials spoke highly of this test launch, believing that it showed that Pakistan has joined the ranks of the few countries that have the ability to develop cruise missiles. Pakistani President Musharraf was even more pleased to say that this move was a milestone in the improvement of Pakistan's nuclear capabilities. Pakistani public opinion believes that although the specific performance parameters of the  Babur missile have not been announced, it will definitely become an important weapon against India in the future, and the nuclear attack capability of the cruise missile will also enhance Pakistan\u2019s Nuclear deterrence.",

It is likely to be the first time in  8 years Major  test firing. On June 18, U.S. officials reported:  North Korea  Satellite images of the launch site on the east coast show that liquid fuel tanks have been installed on the missiles. Fueling is the final step in preparing a liquid-fueled missile for launch, leading to speculation that  North Korea  will test-fire the missile. The report also states that the booster rocket has been installed on the launch pad. The Taepodong-2 is a three-stage missile. It is certain that the first stage is composed of the Nodong missile, which is a single-stage, short-range rocket; the second stage may be the Nodong missile; and the third stage may use solid fuel. U.S. officials are convinced that  North Korea  has enough plutonium for at least six nuclear weapons and has already produced a small number, but the number of nuclear weapons is still increasing.  August 1998  ,  North Korea   launched   Taepodong-1 missile  over Japan.",

The engine is being developed by Boeing, the prime contractor for the NMD program. It is a thrust reversal type of the graphite epoxy engine 40 of  ATK Company  used in the Delta-II rocket, and will serve as the first stage booster of the three-stage NMD ground-based interceptor missile. This test run completed the development and qualification stages of the engine and nozzle.  The next mission to be completed in the near future  is the final  test  of this  thrust vector control system  which must be completed before the entire engine can be flight qualified.  ATK Corporation  estimates that if the NMD program continues, total solid motor sales will exceed $200 million over the next eight years.",

Including investment in the project after the  Indian   nuclear   test was launched, the development and construction costs of the  Arihant  have to $62.4. Military officials said the boat is still at least two years away from being commissioned. Some officials have suggested that the  Arihant  will ultimately become a technology demonstrator rather than a truly operational strategic asset. At this ceremony, officials said that  Arihant  will begin operations for the first time and verify all equipment and systems, after which its port and sea trials will also begin.  Submarines  will become an important part of India's strategic nuclear deterrence, which includes a series of platforms of the army, navy and air force. The submarine is capable of carrying 12 submarine-launched missiles and may also be equipped with Sagarika missiles.",

Nuclear-powered submarines have advantages over conventional-powered submarines. Conventional diesel-electric submarines need to frequently surface to replenish oxygen to recharge their batteries, while nuclear-powered submarines can operate underwater for a long time.

This capability is crucial to  India because  India  The commitment of no first use of nuclear weapons requires  India to have a strong nuclear counterattack capability.

Therefore, the laser and the indicator/tracker are independent of each other, allowing the operator to freely switch lasers during flight without readjusting the aiming system, ensuring the aiming accuracy of the laser. The ITT system's designators/trackers will be placed on both sides of the aircraft, allowing it to locate approaching missiles from any direction. A single laser provides the designation/trackers on both sides with lasers via rugged light pipes and fiber optic lines installed inside the aircraft. bundle. The system is equipped with a universal pointer to provide nearly full coverage tracking, eliminating the need to install a second laser and saving weight. In addition, IRCM uses a new type of quantum cascade laser that is more compact and powerful than traditional diode lasers and harnesses it as a controllable energy source.  ITT Corporation has completed flight  testing on a  U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter with an existing  missile warning system , to test the capabilities of the system, the test location is  Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst, New Jersey.",

A total of 10 joint high-speed transport ships are planned to be built. They will be built by  Austal Shipyard in the United States . They are a general-purpose, non-combat transport ship that will be used to quickly transport troops, military vehicles and equipment in theaters. Henry Stevens said: As the second Pioneer-class joint high-speed transport ship, the successful launch of  Choctaw City is an important milestone for the entire project.  Choctaw City  was built based on the experience of the JHSV1 Pioneer, so it was more complete than the Pioneer when it was launched. The Joint High Speed \u200b\u200bTransport Ship was designed to commercial standards with only limited modifications to suit military use. The ship can transport 600 tons of supplies and sail 1,200 nautical miles at a speed of 35 knots, and can work in ports and channels with shallow drafts. The ship also has an aviation flight deck that can support aircraft flight operations day and night. There are three cities in the United States named Choctaw City, located in Mississippi, Alabama and Oklahoma.  After delivery of   U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command ,  JSHV2  will officially become a U.S. Navy ship, with a core crew of 21 to operate and navigate the ship.",

Precision  JDAM  Initial plans said the weapon would be integrated into the F/A-18 aircraft being developed by  Boeing  for use by the Navy.  JDAM  is an iron-cased bomb equipped with a tail assembly and a GPS guidance system.  Boeing  will keep the cost of precision  JDAM  under $40,000. The current cost of  JDAM  is about $20,000. The exact  JDAM  required  seeker  would be a low-cost  seeker  . This  seeker  will increase the circular probability error of the weapon to more than 3 meters.  The U.S. Air Force  and  The Boeing Company  are preparing to  evaluate  the proposed  seeker  option.

The U.S. Navy has  tested a  seeker that can withstand direct attack munitions, during a  demonstration test , the seeker enables the weapon's accuracy to reach 1 meter in the event of GPS guidance failure. The cost of DAMASK is estimated at $20,000, but the seeker does not meet the needs of attacking mobile targets.",

    "doctext": " The U.S. Air Force  recently announced that it has  tested  a  new airborne wireless router system  that will provide real-time tactical information to troops on the ground in the battlefield. The main difference between this router and the usual router is that this router is connected to a fighter jet. It is essentially a software upgrade known as  Net-T , designed for the advanced targeting pods of some fighter jets and B-1 bombers. Ground troops can remotely operate the video-enhanced receiver to communicate with fighter jets using a small touchscreen device that can be mounted on the arm. These troops can only communicate with aircraft in the air and cannot communicate beyond visual range with other ROVER-5 equipped personnel. But with the upgrade of  Net-T , ground troops equipped with ROVER-5 can communicate directly through the  wireless router  on the aircraft. Once the pilot activates the pod's NET-T transmission mode, he must remain within the range of the ROVER transmitter and within the user's field of vision, while the pod receives little or no interference. The test team at  Elgin Air Force Base   tested  the range and capabilities of the  router  by tracking the size and type of files sent.  NET-T  is expected to be installed on fighter aircraft in 2014.",

In the plan, a  remotely controlled aircraft released a  airdrop detector at a specified point near the airdrop area to collect for the approaching  transport aircraft Meteorological data. During the  test on  March 18, the squadron's  C-130 transport aircraft successfully received  detector data , but no actual airdrop was attempted. Capt. Andrew Standeford, the squadron's precision airdrop system operator, said using the  detectors  to help establish wind profiles will help crews deliver supplies as accurately as possible. Airdropping the probe from a different platform means that  transport aircraft  no longer need to make two passes over the airdrop area, reducing the number of times  aircraft  are exposed to threats. SPAid also makes it easy to shorten delivery time. According to Robert Olson, a joint terminal attack manager with the U.S. Air Mobility Command's 817th Expeditionary Air Support Operations Squadron, which sponsored the SPAid test, this shaved 40 minutes off the normal time required.",

This provides a reliable guarantee for the smooth progress of the  Visby  construction plan. The planning of engineering sea trials and pre-service testing under the direction of  Kockums  went very smoothly, requiring only minor adjustments. During the test, the ship showed excellent performance, which provides assurance for sailors who will pilot the modified version in the future.  Visby Frigate is the world's first surface ship built with a fully stealthy design, carbon fiber, which will make the ship difficult to detect, even with the latest and most advanced radar and Infrared reconnaissance equipment is also difficult to detect. The ship also has the ability to comprehensively perform multiple combat missions, making it a true warship for the future. The advancement of stealth technology is changing the strategic thinking of the world's navies.  Kockums  and the Royal Swedish Navy fully realized its importance in future naval battles and developed and used it. The Royal Swedish Navy has currently ordered five ships of this type and plans to purchase one more.",

India activated the reactor on the  domestically produced Arihant nuclear submarine  in August last year, which accelerated the process of sea trials. After this sea trial, the submarine will be officially  delivered to   the Indian Navy  for use. DRDO Director Avinash Chander told the Press Trust of India that the Arihant is going through a nuclear reactor power upgrade cycle. This is the first time they have carried out relevant work on a nuclear submarine, so they will be very cautious and proceed step by step. This will take one to two months to complete. He was also asked about some information about the domestic nuclear submarine project. In this project, at least three Arihant-class submarines are built for the Navy. He also mentioned that during the sea trial phase, the  Arihant submarine  will test-fire the mature  medium-range nuclear missile BO-5  . The missile has a range of more than 700 kilometers. After the nuclear submarine is put into service, India will have a triad of nuclear strike capabilities and can launch missiles carrying nuclear warheads from different environments on land, sea and air. Nuclear submarines have the ability to sail into the high seas and sail for long periods of time without surfacing. Conventional diesel-electric submarines must surface regularly for ventilation.  Arihant submarine has been undergoing  debugging at   Indian Navy Visakhapatnam Base and has Cleaning up most of the port acceptance testing facilities.",

The United States has expressed opposition to the deal, but the  French DCNS company , which builds the  aircraft carrier , insists that Western sanctions against Russia will not affect the construction and transfer of the Mistral class. In early September,  France  threatened to suspend the supply of the helicopter carrier because Moscow unilaterally created the crisis in Ukraine. Later, a French government spokesman told RIA Novosti that the delivery of the ship would not be suspended and that French President Hollande was only expressing his political position. Hollande said that if the situation in Ukraine does not improve by November, he will block the delivery of the ship. He later said he would make a final decision by the end of October. He also said that the two conditions for the smooth delivery of the ship are: \u2460 ceasefire in Ukraine; \u2461 political reconciliation agreement. The French president also stressed that the sanctions imposed by the EU will not hinder the  delivery  of the  Russian helicopter carrier  .",

The second sea trial in August will test the ship's  communications and combat systems  . The two Canberra-class amphibious assault ships are by far the largest ships of the Australian Navy. The hulls of the ships were mainly built by  Navantia Shipyard in Spain  and were then towed by tugboats to Williamston Shipyard in Australia for outfitting. The Canberra-class amphibious assault ship has a crew of 400 people and can carry 1,000 soldiers, 4 landing craft, and 8 helicopters. It can also carry 18 helicopters at the same time. The first Canberra-class ship was delivered to the Navy at the end of last year.",

It is the first naval ship independently built by Poland in 21 years. Semoniak said: Our naval expansion not only incorporates the Polish people's emotions and love for the Baltic Sea, but is also something that must be done in our time. Next we will have the launch of another ship, as well as subsequent decisions about rebuilding our naval force. The new ships from the  Polish shipyard  are good news for Poland as a whole. The new ship will soon undergo sea  sea trials  and is expected to enter service with the Navy late next year. The 95.2-meter-long, 13.5-meter-wide patrol boat will have a displacement of approximately 1,800 tons and a maximum cruising speed of 30 knots per hour. Semoniak added that the construction of the next six ships, which will include patrol boats and coast guard vessels, is being negotiated with the Polish Armed Forces Group. The minister said: There is no doubt that in the Baltic Sea we need such possibilities, and what is happening in Europe also makes NATO start to see the possibilities in the sea. The new ship is powered by two main engines, which can reach a power of 2*3240kw. It is a continuation of the Gavron multifunctional light cruiser plan.",

The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency provided Congress with the necessary certification for arms sales on July 28, 2015.  Saudi Arabia requested to purchase 600  Patriot PAC-3  cost reduction program missiles, and 8  PAC-3CRI test missiles for  trial  . The total cost is estimated at $5.4 billion. This arms sale will enhance the security of Saudi Arabia, which has been and will continue to be a U.S. ally, and contribute to U.S. foreign policy and national security. Saudi Arabia is a political power in the Middle East. an important force for stability and economic development. The sales will upgrade and replenish  Saudi Arabia's  current stockpile of increasingly older and unsustainable  Patriot missiles  due to limited service life and limited availability of repair parts. This  Patriot PAC-3 missile  transaction will support current and future air and missile defense missions and promote regional stability.  Saudi Arabia  already possesses  Patriot missiles  and will therefore have no difficulty absorbing these new missiles into its armed forces. This arms sale will not change the basic military balance in the region. The prime contractors will be  Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control  , and  Raytheon  . Implementation of this arms sale will require approximately 30  U.S. Government personnel and 40 contractor representatives to travel to  Saudi Arabia for up to 60 months of equipment processing, on-site  Testing,  system   inspection, training, technical and logistical support.",

Wearing the  Powered Walking Collector  reduces battery weight while continuing to provide life-saving power in the fields of communications, navigation and optics. These components are being  tested  under the Joint Infantry Company Prototype Project. The goal of the Joint Infantry Company Prototype program is to develop and test a system capable of powering dismounted units, with the goal of reducing the logistical burden on dismounted units and increasing their self-sufficiency.  Powered Walking  is a lightweight leg exoskeleton that mimics each movement of a soldier and harvests energy while walking or running. The  U.S. Army and  Marine Corps will begin joint  testing under the new contract  early mid-2017 .  Power walking  requires the use of minimal effort while reducing muscle fatigue during downhill walking, thereby reducing metabolic rate and reducing the likelihood of injury. The technical director for the Joint Infantry Company prototype at Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgolen Division said in a statement that field testing is important to help the  Marine Corps and  Army define future small force power programs. is crucial. Data and direct feedback from base exercises are needed to develop technologies and systems that enable forces to achieve power autonomy, where power is generated and managed equal to power consumed.",

Tom, director of the Air Combat and Weapons Division of the Office of Naval Research, said that this system uses multi-spectrum target detection and tracking technology, as well as advanced off-axis beam director and improved fiber laser technology to engage targets at longer distances. In addition, other hardware and software of this system have also been upgraded from the laser weapon prototype currently being tested.  The Office of Naval Research will spend 12 months and US$53 million to develop the  laser weapon system demonstration prototype in three phases: the first phase will mainly complete the initial design, and the second phase will be carried out Ground  testing, the third phase will be  testing on the  Navy Self-Defense Test Ship. Northrop Grumman will be responsible for the design and production of the 150-kilowatt solid laser weapon system and support for shipboard testing. Northrop Grumman said that if the  Office of Naval Research  wants to complete all contract elements, the total contract value and total term will be expanded to $91 million and 34 months. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a  high-energy laser weapon engineering prototype  for the next step of  testing  analysis. It is unclear whether this type of laser weapon will eventually be used in actual combat, but judging from current related work, this type of weapon is likely to be equipped with large surface ships and provide a cheap means of attack and defense.",

The developers stated that the test prototype completed the  test flight  in  2016  in accordance with the project schedule, and its flight was suspended in December of the same year. According to the plan, the first batch of  test prototypes  modified based on the test flight results will continue to  test flights  in the  spring-summer  stage.  Altair series drones  adopt fully automated take-off and landing methods, and can also be converted to manual operation according to the situation. Simultaneous with the manufacturing of test prototypes is the development of weapon systems for a new generation of reconnaissance and strike unmanned systems. Researchers said that the UAV will be equipped with a large number of weapons and equipment, and some prototypes are currently equipped with corresponding weapon systems.  In the summer of 2016  Russia  media reported about the first flight of  Russian heavy UAV   in  Kazan  's message. UAV satellite-produced images from  Kazan Airport  appeared on the web in the autumn. The UAV is equipped with two REDA03/V12 diesel engines with aerial propellers and a take-off power of about 500 horsepower. It can operate continuously for 2 days without supplies and has a maximum flight altitude of 12 kilometers. The body length is 12 meters, the wingspan is about 30 meters, and the maximum flight distance is 10,000 kilometers. Industry experts estimate that the drone weighs about 5 tons. It is reported that the drone may be used to perform tasks such as monitoring the Arctic region. Mass production will begin in 2018. Russia has not yet disclosed any more information about the drone.",

Therefore  Icarus  is a hybrid spacecraft.  Icarus  will be launched from  Tanegashima Space Center   on  May 18   . The assignment period is 6 months.  Icarus  will use photon propulsion, with electricity from solar sails powering onboard equipment. If this experiment is successful, it will be the first time  Icarus  uses this technology in space. Japan says a second  experiment  will be conducted in the  late 2010s  . A medium-sized solar sail with a diameter of 50 meters will be used, combined with an ion propulsion engine, and the launch destination will be Jupiter and Trojan-type asteroids.

Less than 50 days ago, the U.S. Army awarded a contract to the Northrop Grumman/Hybrid Air Vehicles team to demonstrate the feasibility of a long-endurance multi-mission payload vehicle as an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platform. Northrop Grumman chief engineer Michael Addison said that after removing the ISR payload and making the necessary modifications, the same aircraft can carry a payload of 15,875kg. Using the same appearance and changing some structures in the lower part can provide greater carrying capacity. These modifications do not need to change the basic appearance. The high-load shape can carry a load of 15,875kg and fly a distance of 1,852~2,778km. In comparison, the U.S. Air Force's C-130E transport aircraft can carry a load of the same weight and fly a distance of 2,315km. The goal of the LEMV project is to use a  hybrid airship  to perform ISR missions and remain airborne for more than 21 days at an altitude of 20,000 feet.

Singh, the Minister of Science and Technology of India, revealed on  March 4 that the  verification machine that is about to carry out  test flight weighs about 1.5 tons and will be boosted by solid rockets. It reaches an altitude of 70 kilometers and reaches the speed of Ma5. After separating from the booster, it glides down and finally splashes into the sea. This test flight will verify the aircraft's hypersonic aerodynamic characteristics, avionics, thermal protection and control systems, as well as mission management and other technologies.  ISRO  has planned 4 test flights for this project. After this hypersonic test flight, it will successively carry out landing test flights, orbit entry and return test flights, and scramjet propulsion system demonstration and verification tests. The  first flight  of the  RLV technology verification project  was originally planned for  2011  but suffered several delays. As of now, the detailed first flight date has not yet been determined. Indian officials said that this test flight will provide a decision-making basis for the subsequent design and development of a fully reusable two-stage orbital vehicle from the perspective of cost-effectiveness.",

Raytheon engineers will further improve the laser-guided Maverick missile's laser seeker and software to reduce the risk of collateral damage and allow pilots to illuminate targets for the Maverick missile using an airborne laser. The AGM-65E2 laser-guided missile is used by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and the AGM-65L is used by the Air Force. The Maverick missile is used for close air support and targets some tactical targets, such as armored vehicles, air defense equipment, surface ships, ground transport vehicles, oil storage equipment, etc. The young animal can use two types of warheads, one is equipped with a trigger fuse on the head, and the other is an armor-piercing blasting warhead equipped with a delayed fuse. This warhead can penetrate the target with a certain kinetic energy and then detonate. The laser-guided Cub missile adopts beam guidance. It can follow the laser beam emitted by the aircraft or other aircraft in the area, or follow the instructions of the ground laser designator to fly to the designated target. Harry Schulte, deputy director of the air combat system production line of Raytheon Missile Systems, said that the laser-guided Maverick missile is suitable for street combat and attacking fast-moving targets. The Cub, which has been tested in actual combat, is now mounted on more than 25 types of aircraft in 33 countries. Raytheon hopes that the latest Cub missile can be exported as soon as possible.",

Because it often takes weeks or even months to wait for new parts from the Air Force maintenance base, pilots at the air wing's avionics intermediate station have begun repairing the throttle handles and front-end controls on the A-10 by themselves. At the same time, pilots also began to bypass the Air Force to install A-10 component equipment. This part of the work saved the Air Force approximately $1.3 million and improved the A-10C's mission readiness rate.

It is currently envisaged to build 17 ships, of which 9 will be land-attack types and 8 will be anti-submarine types, all of which will be capable of launching land-attack cruise ships. missile capabilities. The characteristics of these two types of frigates are that they have less than 100 crew members and a high degree of standardization and generalization. Compared with existing frigates, the cost is reduced by 30%. The ship will use the multi-mission version of the SYLVER vertical launch system, which can launch a variety of missiles. The operating cost of the new attack nuclear submarine project will be 1/3 lower than that of the Ruby class, the degree of automation will be higher, and it will only require 60 crew members. Such boats will enhance interoperability and reduce noise. The boat can also launch the French Navy's new land-attack cruise missile from a torpedo tube. As for the plan for the second aircraft carrier after the Charles de Gaulle, it is still a sensitive issue and there is no clear statement yet.",

It is the next generation of offshore battlefield sensing glider unmanned undersea vehicle. According to documents posted on the Naval Information Warfare Systems Command website, the unmanned launch vehicle needs to be able to operate for 90 days at a time, dive to a depth of 200 meters, and collect ocean data samples every two seconds. The Navy hopes that this type of unmanned underwater vehicle can patrol the deep sea or the seabed, and when it surfaces, it can transmit data through Iridium satellites or on-site data links, and the data can be received by survey ships or lifeboats. The drone should also be able to sink itself and clear data if data is compromised, a feature that could be triggered by an operator in a command center or if the machine is compromised. In the future, the U.S. Navy will use unmanned underwater vehicles to sense water conditions in places where submarines need to be hunted and assist in guiding the fleet in operational planning.",

The Department of Defense's Pandex Plant is the nation's only nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly plant, and technicians work around the clock inside the complex working with radioactive and explosive materials. Sealant was used to repair the underground workshop after officials learned that work to repair imperfect door welds in the underground workshop had not been completed six years after the order, according to a report by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The government temporarily suspended work on the nuclear weapons while sealant was used to repair the welds. After this, it starts running again. But on July 21, it was reported that an official and the Nuclear Facilities Safety Commission found that the sealant was peeling off. Now, safety board officials say it would cost $15 million to $20 million to seal the potential leak. Engineers at the plant are studying the scope of the problem and will report their findings to the safety committee.

The key research facility used is an inertial confinement fusion device. Therefore, its development is not restricted by the Comprehensive Nuclear Ban Treaty and can be used as a conventional weapon in the military. . Currently, there are three types of fourth-generation nuclear weapons being studied by the United States, France, Russia and other countries: Metallic hydrogen weapons: Hydrogen can be converted into solid crystals under a certain pressure and can be maintained at room temperature for a long time without sealing. This is metallic hydrogen. . The explosive power of metallic hydrogen is equivalent to 25 to 35 times that of TNT explosive of the same mass. It is the most powerful chemical explosive currently imaginable. Nuclear isomers: Nuclear isomers are approximately one gigajoule/gram, which is 1 million times more energetic than high explosives. Nuclear isomers can be obtained through nucleosynthesis using neutron pulses generated by microexplosions in heavy ion collisions or inertial confinement fusion. Like metallic hydrogen, nuclear isomer weapons can be used as conventional weapons or as triggers for clean hydrogen bombs. Antimatter weapons: A very small amount of matter interacts with its antimatter counterpart to rapidly release huge amounts of energy, enough to compress a plutonium or uranium pellet to create a chain reaction. Just a few micrograms of antimatter can be used as a trigger for a thermonuclear explosion, or to stimulate extremely powerful X-ray or gamma-ray lasers. Antimatter is the most important type of fourth-generation nuclear weapons currently being studied. The production and research of antimatter is being carried out at the Fermi National Accelerator Institute in the United States, the European Center for Nuclear Research jointly built by France and Switzerland, and the Institute of High Energy Physics in Russia.",

The 282-foot submarine, which has been a Russian floating submarine museum since 2002, attracted tens of thousands of visitors before it sank in a storm in April 2007. The dive team had to wait for the best conditions, then inject air into the sub and gradually remove the water from inside the sub. According to the plan, the submarine, which is covered by 30-50 feet of water, will surface, and the entire process will take about 10 hours. A spokesman for the submarine salvage team said: The bow of the submarine will surface first, and then other parts will surface. Several questions remain during the salvage operation, including how much silt may be weighing down the submarine. After the submarine is salvaged and safely placed in its predetermined location, special teams will enter the submarine to ensure that there are no harmful gases inside. Once the air is determined to have been cleared, inspectors can inspect the submarine for damage. The submarine was first launched in 1965 and was incorporated into the Soviet Northern Fleet, named K-77 or Juliette 484. The submarine was the only submarine on display in the United States, and before its sinking, it was one of two on display outside the Soviet Union.",

The Indian Navy is inviting bids to purchase six conventional submarines, and the Amur-class Type 1650 submarine is one of the submarines participating in the bid. Other types of submarines participating in the bidding competition include France's Catfish class, Germany's Type 214 submarine and Spain's S-80 class submarine. The Amur-class Type 1650 submarine is equipped with multi-functional torpedoes and anti-ship missiles. In addition, it can also use advanced cruise missiles such as BrahMos to effectively attack land targets. The submarine can rely on the AIP system to continuously perform combat missions underwater for up to 25 days, which is 5 to 10 days longer than similar foreign submarines. AIP submarines usually use hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells, which are quieter than traditional diesel-electric submarines. They do not need to surface or use the submarine's ventilation device to breathe, so the chance of exposing themselves to radar and other sensors is also low. greatly reduced.",

The purpose is to integrate two new weapons, the US-made small diameter bomb and the AGM-88E advanced anti-radiation missile, into the Tornado fighter. The AGM-88E advanced anti-radiation missile uses a radio frequency seeker that can memorize target characteristics and location, which means it can effectively attack targets with radar shutdown. He also has the ability to target point selection, that is, he can select the weakest part of the target to attack, such as choosing to attack the radar's computer processor instead of the transmitting antenna. The positioning capability ensures that advanced anti-radiation missiles will not accidentally damage friendly forces. The missile is suitable for performing the task of suppressing enemy air defense firepower in emergency combat situations. The small-diameter bomb has been in service with the U.S. Air Force since 2006. It has a maximum range of 96 kilometers and has the ability to strike outside the zone. It can penetrate hard targets and maintain high accuracy and low collateral damage. The bomb is available in two types: GBU-39GPS/INS guided type and GBU-54 laser+GPS/INS guided type.

After the first delivery of this weapon system in 2010, there were deficiencies in hit rate. The South Korean Institute of Defense Research completed its improvements in May this year. After the South Korean Navy equips the improved version of the Red Shark, it will have world-leading anti-submarine combat capabilities. . When attacking an enemy submarine, the flying red shark will open its parachute before contacting the water to reduce the impact, and release it after entering the water to attack the enemy. Generally speaking, the ultimate speed of a torpedo cannot exceed the speed of sound. The submarine determines the opponent's position through sound, but due to seawater resistance, the sound will reach the submarine before the torpedoes. The submarine can avoid the torpedo attack by running away at full speed after hearing the sound. In order to overcome this, the newly developed Red Shark launches induced bombs and flies into the sea area near enemy submarines to weaken the sound of torpedoes, thus making it more difficult for enemy submarines to distinguish. The Red Shark is composed of a vertical launch induced bomb, a vertical launch system, and a launch control system. Its thrust direction controller has significantly improved in withstanding high temperatures, and its inertial overcoming device makes the hit rate higher than that of the American VLA.

Current anti-missile systems use ballistic prediction algorithms to intercept ballistic missiles. But HGV breaks this logical principle through non-ballistic flight. Chairman Ellison further explained that the launch method of HGV is similar to that of ballistic missiles, but it does not enter space. Instead, it is released at high altitude and performs jumping and gliding maneuvers in the thin atmosphere, and finally hits the target. Nonetheless, the weapon can still be intercepted during a certain phase of flight. Ellison pointed out that the U.S. military's THAAD terminal high-level area anti-missile system can intercept HGVs at high altitudes before they maneuver.

The report pointed out that offshore areas gather important economic infrastructure and population centers, so in a war with limited targets, the ability to effectively control key points in offshore areas is very important. The expanded scope of anti-access and area denial due to the combination of precision strike weapons and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance makes traditional amphibious assaults more difficult.

Raytheon researchers began developing a high-energy solid-state laser with a power of 4 kilowatts a year ago and increased the power to 25 kilowatts this summer. The U.S. Department of Defense will sign a contract in October this year to develop a solid-state laser with a power of 100 kilowatts for laboratory verification. The competition faced by lasers as weapons is not only to have high power, but also to have high-quality laser beams, and to be small enough to be installed on tactical aircraft and ground combat vehicles. Raytheon's solid-state laser laboratory plans to amplify existing 25-kilowatt solid-state lasers into 100-kilowatt lasers. The laser uses a phase coupling lens to correct the optical aberration generated by the laser itself and the optical aberration caused by the atmosphere between the launch platform and the target, so that after miniaturization, the laser can be used both in aircraft and on the move. A heavy-duty truck or trailer can be launched directly at the target, or it can direct the laser beam emitted by the platform to the target to be attacked through a computer-controlled relay lens mounted on a tethered balloon or unmanned helicopter.",

So far, the Spanish army is apparently the only customer of this weapon system. Due to its unit price and technical level, Alcotan-100 still belongs to the high-end market of MANPAD. Despite its superior technology and Instalaza's steadily improving reputation, Aloctan-100 still faces a situation where the international market has been flooded and the domestic market is limited. Ongoing combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have highlighted the increased need for lightweight, shoulder-fired weapons for infantrymen to effectively engage a variety of targets. The Aloctan-100 and related weapons should be particularly suitable to fill this need. However, we cannot confirm whether the Spanish army uses the Aloctan-100 weapon system in combat. Without operational validation to promote today's international markets, Aloctan-100 would still be at a significant disadvantage in the market. In fact, there is no evidence that Aloctan-100 has ever been exported. Both export orders and follow-up orders for the Spanish army at a medium level are likely to recover this year.

It is the same AMRAAM we use now, just one more; it may be installed on the weapons bay door. Currently, the F-35 can carry two AMRAAM missiles in each side weapons bay, or a mix of AMRAAM and Joint Direct Attack Munitions.

The contract originated from an agreement reached during the Norwegian Defense Minister's visit to Australia in 2015. JSM is Norway's new generation of long-range precision strike missile, which will be integrated into the embedded cabin of the F-35 fighter jet. The missile can fly at low altitudes along the terrain and uses advanced materials and advanced passive seekers, which makes detection and interception by current advanced air defense systems extremely difficult. BAE Systems Australia will develop an advanced radio frequency seeker for the JSM, which will enable the JSM to lock on to targets based on their electronic signature.

In his speech, Bush talked for the first time about the transfer of nuclear technology by Qadir Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, to Libya, Iran and North Korea, revealed the inside story of Qadir Khan's establishment of an underground nuclear smuggling network, and expressed his disapproval of Pakistani President Musharraf's expressed appreciation for its stance on combating nuclear smuggling. Bush proposed reforming the operation of the International Atomic Energy Agency and reiterated his call for the Security Council to pass a new resolution requiring member states to take stricter measures to combat illegal weapons proliferation activities such as black market trading. Media analysts here believe that Bush's speech does not have much maneuverability. The New York Times wrote an article pointing out that Bush is obviously practicing double standards again. While he called on other countries to control the proliferation of nuclear technology and equipment, he continued to encourage the Ministry of Defense to develop projects to develop small earth-penetrating nuclear weapons. At the same time, in his speech, he also clearly opposed the revision initiative proposed by the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency ElBaradei. The initiative calls for the creation of an international organization to regulate the production and use of nuclear fuel rods in all countries.",

Senior officials at the Office of Naval Research cited areas of research primarily designed to meet near- and long-term goals for the Navy and the U.S. military. Offshore surface ships, known as X-boats, are the main project of recent research. The main feature of this type of boats is that they can reach a speed of 50 knots in relatively harsh sea areas. The boat is currently in the experimental testing phase, but by 2006, the Navy expects to have a basic idea of \u200b\u200bthe personnel the boat can deploy. The patrol boat is an ideal platform for training new naval crews on offshore patrol boats. To help position troops on the battlefield, the Office of Naval Research is working on a small tactical unmanned vehicle, the Silver Fox, which weighs 24 pounds and is expected to be worth thousands of dollars and can stay in the air for 20 hours. The project will need to be demonstrated by the Naval Air Systems Command before being applied. In the future, the Office of Naval Research will also invest in electronic laser weapons and naval electromagnetic guns. After investing $1 billion in the electromagnetic gun project, the Navy will also research and develop weapons that can fire on moving targets at sea beyond 200 nautical miles.",

In March 2005, Phil spoke at the 2005 Future Artillery Annual Conference in London, saying that technologies in the fields of pulse energy and capacitors have matured, but a large number of land applications are still needed. Therefore, pulse alternators emerged as the preferred low-cost solution. The U.S. Navy is studying what Phil calls an important ultra-long-range artillery science and technology project. Its main research topics include artillery life and high-overload-resistant guidance, navigation and control capabilities. If this project is successful, the electromagnetic gun will achieve overwhelming lethality while significantly improving survivability and logistics capabilities. The University of Texas Advanced Technology Institute has designed common low-cost artillery projectile concepts to use railgun launchers for Navy surface fire support and Army off-line attack. The bullet has a flight mass of 15 kilograms and can carry multiple energy arrow-shaped bullets or a small number of tungsten core armor-piercing bullets. In naval applications, the projectile has a muzzle kinetic energy of 64 megajoules; a muzzle velocity of 2,500 meters per second; a maximum range of more than 500 kilometers, and an impact speed of 1,600 meters per second. In ground applications, the projectile's muzzle kinetic energy is 20 megajoules; its muzzle velocity is 1,400 meters per second, and its impact speed over a range of 100 kilometers is 700 meters per second.",

Whether it is high-energy microwave weapons or laser weapons, they have the potential to be used as non-lethal weapons. Attacking electro-optical sensors with laser weapons will soon become a reality, but there are still technical challenges, such as target identification and classification, as well as the need to solve the target tracking problem to ensure that the laser beam has enough time to stay on the target. It must be ensured that no damage is caused to human eyes. Considering that the radio frequency output of high-energy microwave weapons is attenuated, it is unrealistic to require a long range of action. The initial model will require the carrier platform to fly over the target to carry out the attack. Further discussion and decision are needed as to what type of high-energy microwave weapon to use, whether it is omnidirectional or directional.",

Phased array radars can do more than detect small, even stealth missiles. With some modifications, these aircraft could use this radar to attack enemy air-to-air, surface-to-air and cruise missiles using false target signals or high-energy microwave pulses. This high-energy microwave pulse can damage electrical components. The U.S. Navy says it is currently exploring such technological avenues. A squadron of two-seat F/A-18F aircraft has been equipped with AESA radar for precision maritime combat missions. However, the Navy has not yet fully mastered directed energy capabilities. A senior Pentagon official said: High-energy microwave attack on cruise missiles is a technology that, whether it has been completed on the F/A-18E/F aircraft or will be carried out on the G-model aircraft, is of great significance to the requirements office.

For example,  U.S. Marines  approached the building where the key figures were located at  2 a.m. . Behind the building was a maze of paths, so  dispatched  a  drone  to hover behind the building. As  Marines  entered the front of the building, a Marine sergeant gave the order to clear the target. In this case, the  drone  fires a laser to identify the target, and the F-16 fighter jet launches a missile to destroy the target.  Drones  are controlled in real time from Nellis Air Force Base, 7,000 miles away, in an expeditionary operation. In an attack involving real-time information exchange, the person controlling the  drone  cannot see the target at all and is not even in the country. This is something I have never experienced before, and this method of combat is very different from the previous methods. Another difference is that thanks to advances in technology, lessons learned in combat can be summarized and applied to future battles more quickly through the Internet. Experience and lessons accumulated on the battlefield can be directly transmitted to military academies through information sharing. More importantly, empirical data can often be transmitted directly to theater platforms, allowing military personnel in theater and in the United States to quickly utilize this information.",

SDB is produced by Boeing Company. The bomb weighs 113kg. It adopts global satellite positioning system guidance method and high-explosive lethality and penetration warhead. The maximum attack range is about 75km. Each F-15E fighter can carry 3 BRU-61 pylons under the wings, and each pylon can carry 4 SDBs. Therefore, an F-15E can be equipped with 12 SDBs, thus greatly increasing the number of attack targets. In addition to F-15E fighter jets, SDB will also be equipped with F-22, F-35 fighter jets and Predator B drones in the future. In order to improve the ability to attack ground mobile targets,  the U.S. Air Force and the Navy are jointly conducting the SDBII project. The bidders are Lockheed Martin/Boeing and Raytheon. The focus will be on 3 on the mold guide head. Despite already participating in the SDBII project, the U.S. Navy still favors using laser-guided bombs and laser-guided joint direct attack munitions to attack ground mobile targets, although they also believe that the U.S. Navy's air-to-ground capabilities will only be equipped with SDBII in 2014 on its F-35s.

This kind of boat has high stealth and good affordability, and can be deployed in large numbers. Its basic combat technical indicators are: a maximum speed of 38 knots, a minimum range of 3,000 nautical miles, the ability to carry 190 tons of frame components, and the ability to sail in sea state level 6. The ship is actually a combination of two boats. There is one in the front, called the  Combat Craft , which tows a so-called grid deployment module boat 20 feet behind using a semi-fixed tow system. The hull structure of the two boats is the same, both are wave-piercing catamaran hulls. This type of boat has the advantages of good seaworthiness, low resistance when sailing at high speed, shallow draft and large deck area. The  combat boat   in the front is equipped with  sensors  ,  electronic countermeasures  ,  anti-ship and anti-aircraft weapon systems , as well as compartments to accommodate Special Forces soldiers; the grille deployment module boat at the rear has space for nine half-size sensor or weapons modules. A half-size module space measures 18 feet wide, 11 feet long and 9 feet deep. These modules are arranged longitudinally along the centerline of the boat and can carry vertical missile launch systems, fuel, special forces equipment, etc. When carrying the fuel module, fuel can be replenished to the forward boat through the umbilical cord to increase the range. In addition, the rear boat can also be equipped with a generator or decoy launching system. In times of crisis, a false target can be formed by abandoning the rear boat to protect the submarine.",

Peony can fire at ground and sea targets, which will greatly strengthen Kaliningrad's military strength. Together with the coastal Bar and Fortress missiles and the 220mm Uragon multiple rocket launcher, it is enough to pose a major threat to enemy forces. The Russian Navy began a large-scale upgrade of the 203 mm diameter Peony howitzer a few years ago. The upgrade focused on the fire control system, aiming to integrate it into the troop automation control system to monitor ground, air, airborne, and naval reconnaissance forces in real time. There, information on potential targets is obtained, providing the capability to destroy tactical targets behind enemy lines including control stations and communications centers, artillery and missile bases, helicopter pads, and ammunition and fuel dumps. Zoo radar will provide real-time guidance to detect targets, adjust firepower, and destroy enemy artillery positions.",

The Global Positioning System, operated by the United States, is the most widely used satellite navigation system in the world.  The European Union  wants to have its own navigation system -  Galileo  , which is not yet in use. The United States currently has 30 GPS satellites in orbit. The satellites send signals that enable receivers to determine their location with positioning accuracy within a few meters. This is typically used for in-vehicle satellite navigation.  The European Union  plans to have 30 satellites around 2010, with a fully operational  Galileo system   deployed  in place by 2012. The United States said the deal, to be signed this week, would see  EU  and U.S. satellites transmit information on the same radio frequencies, allowing receivers to pick up signals from both systems and combine data. The advantage of this agreement is whether the receiver manufacturer produces receivers using both systems. A senior State Department adviser said the market may drive a dual-purpose receiver. The idea of \u200b\u200ba receiver acquiring data from 60 satellites could make positioning information more precise, especially in areas with weak reception. The United States is updating its GPS system, purchasing new satellites and planning to launch them before 2013. An EU spokesperson confirmed that the agreement is still in the negotiation stage and it is not yet certain when an agreement will be reached.",

The Netherlands plans to purchase multiple JSFs to replace its aging F-16 fighter fleet. In the past, procurement was delayed due to rising costs, and now JSF's noise problem has attracted attention again. Recent data from the U.S. Air Force shows that the JSF's noise level during takeoff reaches up to 130 decibels, far exceeding the standards set by the Netherlands. The  JSF  procured by  Netherlands will be  stationed at  Levaten Air Base in the province of Frisia and environmental regulations will JSF is prohibited from taking off from the base. Due to strong requests from the Frisian Provincial Senate, the Dutch Deputy Defense Minister issued an order to conduct a new round of research on the noise problem of the Joint Strike Fighter. The Dutch national agency responsible for aerospace recalculated the data and the result was 110 decibels. Residents near Levaton Air Base and the Frisian Provincial Council have expressed concerns about the discrepancy in the data. In February 2010, the Dutch House of Representatives will again discuss the purchase of JSF or Lockheed Martin's F-35 Lightning II fighter jets. The purchase plan is causing heated debate in the Netherlands because the United States does not disclose information about the actual cost of the aircraft, which means that the Netherlands may face serious financial risks. Regarding the noise causes of JSF, detailed examination of each node of the JSF project will still be carried out. However, several parties want the procurement plan scrapped, including the ruling Labor Party and the opposition Socialist Party.",

The U.S. House of Representatives Armed Forces Committee on Wednesday approved a portion of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 that includes Navy shipbuilding, including an amendment that places special emphasis on the Littoral Combat Ship project. If this amendment is included in the final version of the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act, the GAO will need to study some aspects of the Littoral Combat Ship program. The research content will mainly include the project's research and development plan, weight management plan, achievements in achieving commonality between two different types of ships, the project's mission module development and testing status, etc. The amendments also require the Government Accountability Office to examine issues arising from the  Littoral Combat Ship  deployment to  Singapore and will also examine   Navy proposed review of design and capability changes to  Littoral Combat Ships being built now and in the future. The House Arms and Armament Committee also expressed concerns about the size of the Navy's fleet. Future reductions in fleet size may affect national security. This amendment does not provide more funding for naval ships, but requires the Ministry of National Defense and the  Navy  to focus on developing some shipbuilding projects. The amendment points out that future budgets must truly reflect the funding that can meet the needs of the country's force structure.",

Managers of BAE Systems' CV90 platform said that they are paying more and more attention to solving environmental problems caused by fuel economy. This need first drove BAE Systems to upgrade Swedish armored fighting vehicles as early as the 1980s.  Sweden  CV90 armored vehicle has been  deployed in  Liberia, and the cost per liter of fuel for Swedish troops during combat operations in Afghanistan was approximately US$107, while the U.S. military during the same period reported higher costs, creating a logistical burden. Fuel efficiency is particularly important for users with equipment needs. Therefore, there is no need to be surprised when hybrid electric drive  CV90 armored vehicle  appears on the future battlefield, it will save costs by 10% to 30%. In addition, the hybrid electric propulsion system can also provide more powerful power for the 30-ton combat vehicle. The system consists of a standard diesel engine and battery pack, which can provide additional forward power or additional electric power to the vehicle. This technology may allow BAE Systems to enter into an upgrade contract with Poland's local Polish Defense Holding Company for approximately 600 combat vehicles.",

The company's innovative radar technology provides 360\u00b0 omnidirectional and \u00b145\u00b0 elevation coverage with no mechanical moving parts. ARTsys360 Company describes the  RS-400 radar  as a lightweight, low-cost, compact, reliable, low-power  micro radar system  . The radar's 100 milliwatt output means it is human-safe and complies with FCC regulations. It is said that the system can detect drones, human targets and vehicles at a distance of 800 meters at 360\u00b0. Its size and coverage means the radar could also be used to coordinate drone traffic over urban areas. According to ARTsys360, detecting drones in urban areas requires the deployment of a large number of radars to overcome the blind spots caused by high-rise buildings. The lower price of  RS-400 radar  gives it a cost/performance advantage. The radar system costs less than $50,000, compared with $150,000 to $300,000 for phased array radars. In addition, the company also said that it is developing a new radar weighing only 1kg as a drone-mounted sense and avoid sensor.",

Although it is designed for use as an exoatmospheric anti-personnel weapon, it could potentially be used to improve the capabilities of many other future versions of exoatmospheric missile systems.  The ADLT system uses an ultra-stable laser transmitter to interrogate the target like a radar system, receiving the energy reflected from the target and performing Doppler processing. It first collects range and velocity data, and then generates a The Doppler image of the resolved range can be used to understand the microdynamics of the target.

Research on the A400M project found some problems.  EADS  also re-evaluates demonstrated aircraft that have met performance parameters and aircraft that have not met schedule requirements. The areas of risk identified in the study were system design, particularly wiring. Wiring also affects A380 delays. But mission system maturity, engine improvements and other work to be done on the final assembly line are also cited as issues of concern.  EADS  stated that the company's two CEOs, Tom Enders and Louis Gallois, will conduct reviews every two months to resolve existing issues during the process. One of the issues to pay attention to is when the assembly plant in Seville, Spain will officially start construction. Company officials do not want to be like the A380, where final assembly begins before other preparations are completed. But it also stated that the project did not suffer from the problems of insufficient and inappropriate use of design tooling encountered by the A380. The military was briefed on the findings over the weekend. However, they are still worried about the delay in A400M delivery. These users are facing the serious aging problem of transport aircraft.",

Surprisingly, Liu Yanming was not a scout, but an infantry fighting vehicle commander. Most of the players competing with him came from different majors such as armor and artillery. According to the leader of the division, in the past, joint discussions were mostly reserved for commanders, and combatants only needed to complete tasks according to time points. Nowadays, every commander and fighter must not only have joint awareness and joint literacy, but also the frequency and time proportion of joint training have been significantly improved. The author saw at the competition site that each major and each category has joint subject competitions: agency staff use the integrated command information system to draw determination maps in the context of joint operations; detachment combatants identify and observe multiple groups of targets in the air and ground. Share reconnaissance intelligence and guide fire strikes; coaches jointly teach theoretical content based on combat position settings, accounting for one-fifth of the scoring. The move of joint subjects to the forefront of competitions is a new change brought about by the implementation of the new syllabus. Many veterans like Liu Yanming are deeply touched by this change. This year, for the first time, the use of observation equipment has been set as a separate subject. The trainees have also expanded from reconnaissance majors to all combatants.

PrecISR  translates the latest advances in active array and digital receiver technology into a scalable, high-performance sensor that can be mounted on helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles and fixed-wing mission aircraft. Thanks to software-defined radar modes and electronic beam steering,  PrecISR  can perform different tasks almost simultaneously, detecting, tracking and classifying thousands of targets, truly finding a needle in a haystack. Due to its compact design and all components located outside the fuselage,  PrecISR  greatly simplifies integration with the aircraft platform compared to other radars.

The new armor, called composite lightweight improved reactive armor, can avoid the threat to soldiers and other personnel caused by metal plates and fragments produced when the standard sandwich explosive reactive armor explodes. Due to the shortcomings of standard sandwich explosive reactive armor, many countries have even banned the use of explosive reactive armor. CLARA replaces metal sheets with fiber plastic. The reason is that after being attacked by a shaped charge jet, the debris generated by the explosion of the former module is less harmful than the debris generated by the explosion of the latter module. Each CLARA module weighs 18.5kg and is only 100mm thick. The CLARA program is supported by the Defense Technology and Acquisition Agency.  BWB  has successfully conducted  trials  using the  RPG7-V anti-tank weapon  on the armor-reinforced Marder 1A5 infantry fighting vehicle. The test used the  RPG-7 anti-tank weapon  copied by Nobel Company. Its jet can penetrate 350 mm thick rolled homogeneous armor.

    "doctext": " Russia  The  A-100 airborne early warning aircraft  being developed will have electronic attack capabilities to interfere with enemy radars and communications, which is different from the American early warning aircraft. Russian defense experts said: If the American AWACS carries out electronic attacks, it will interfere with the work of its own radar and is also susceptible to interference from the airborne monitoring base station. This makes the American early warning aircraft less efficient and vulnerable to attack. The F-22 cannot do without the early warning aircraft. Yes, the F-22 turns off its radar during an attack and relies entirely on the early warning aircraft to provide detection data within a range of 400 kilometers. AWACS aircraft may become targets of camouflaged air defense weapons, such as Russia's S-400 missiles. On the contrary, the  A-100 's airborne systems do not interfere with its radar operation, making the flight less likely to be locked and tracked by the enemy.  A-100  Mission System  Testing  will begin in  March 2017  and if all goes well,  A-100  It will enter service in 2018.  A-100 's multi-target detection radar can detect surface ships within 600 kilometers and enemy fighter jets within 400 kilometers. Russian experts also said that  A-100  can be used as both a receiver and a transmitter in the UHF band, which can significantly improve the detection range and accuracy, and can avoid interceptor missile attacks and interfere with the enemy.

Raytheon is developing: a visual interface that allows for the creation and manipulation of swarm tactics via drag-and-drop; a game-based simulator that can evaluate unmanned swarm tactics; an unmanned Swarm physics testbed to conduct evaluations in real-world environments. Dr. Shane Clark of Raytheon Company said: Operators can use voice and gestures to control unmanned swarms, which will bring great combat advantages. For complete situational awareness, the OFFSET system can provide sensor feedback and mission status indications to soldiers. The flexible, scalable OFFSET software and simulation environment means users can coordinate the behavior of the swarm. Swarms can be composed of different types of unmanned systems equipped with different sensors. DARPA is inviting other agencies to participate in the OFFSET project as sprinters. Each sprinter can launch their own innovative swarm tactic, and  Raytheon  will work with them to evaluate the tactic in a simulated or real-world environment.  In 2016,  Raytheon Company, as a participating research unit of the Office of Naval Research's LOCUST project, successfully carried out 30  Coyote drone swarms  Demonstration Verification.",

Denmark's deal is smaller, with the targeted purchase of 28 AIM-120C-7 weapons, as well as related support services and an AMRAAM backup guidance section, for an estimated cost of $90 million. These weapons may support the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Both countries have agreed to purchase aircraft manufactured by  Lockheed Martin  , which has undergone successful  testing  of the  AIM-120  . In both cases, the prime contractor is Raytheon, whose Tucson, Arizona, location is the center of the company's work. Unlike the UK, which has requested industrial compensation, Denmark has requested industrial compensation and the agreement has not been finalized and will be determined during negotiations between the buyer and contractor, according to a statement from the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency. As with all DSA announcements, the sale must be approved by the Senate before negotiations can begin; total quantities and dollar amounts change frequently between the initial DSA announcement and the final sale.",

A Turkish official said: Turkey has decided not to allow other countries to use Turkish bases to launch attacks against  Iraq , including conducting reconnaissance missions, because the demands of the war itself have now exceeded the requirements for patrol operations themselves. Thus,  U.S.   plans to attack   Iraq  will Further complications. Previously,  the United States  had much higher expectations for support from T\u00fcrkiye. Some people believe that Turkey did this in response to  the United States 's attack on  Iraq . However, a British Ministry of Defense official said: We are working closely with the Turkish authorities to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Since the end of the Gulf War in 1991, in order to protect the Kurds in northern Iraq, the United States and the UK have been monitoring the no-fly zone in northern Iraq through the use of Turkish bases. The last surveillance flight was on March 17.",

The Pentagon  made the decision after numerous failures in  tests  .  Patriot missiles  are used to defend against medium- and high-altitude aircraft and short-range ballistic missiles. Its improved version PAC-3 has a stronger ability to defend against short-range missiles. The Wall Street Journal pointed out that the most likely part of the system to malfunction is the radio equipment used for navigation.

The missile can carry a nuclear warhead and be launched from a submarine.  The M-51 missile  has a range of approximately 8,000 kilometers and will replace France's current submarine-launched missiles before 2010. A Defense Ministry statement said the flight test was conducted in full compliance with France's international commitments to security, transparency and non-proliferation. French Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said the test was needed to test the performance of future missiles and to take the modernization of our deterrence to the next level.  M-51 missile  It is 12 meters long and weighs about 50 tons. It is manufactured by the European group EADS. It has a cruising altitude of 1,000 meters and can carry six nuclear warheads.

As an upgraded model of the S-300 series, the S-400 Triumph is a new type of air defense missile system. The system is designed to intercept and destroy airborne targets 400 kilometers away, which is twice the range of the MIM-104 Patriot missile and 2.5 times the range of the S-300PMU-2 missile. In April, the special commander of the air defense force said that the system could also be used for limited missile and space defense, but was not intended to destroy intercontinental ballistic missiles. The air defense system is capable of destroying stealth aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. The Russian Air Defense Force is a branch of the Air Force. Currently, more than 30 regiments are equipped with S-300 missile systems, and they will all be gradually replaced by the S-400 system.",

The system consists of two aircraft and a ground control unit. T-Hawk was once part of the U.S. Army's massive Future Combat System program. The T-Hawk aircraft has a visual range of 4 kilometers and a listening range of 2 kilometers. These make the T-Hawk a vulnerable platform for covert reconnaissance and surveillance work.

The United States commissioned the RAND Corporation in 2004 to study possible non-traditional uses of aircraft carriers in the future. Over a six-month period, RAND assembled two research teams that included experienced military and civilian experts, defense analysts, and potential users. One group explores new uses for aircraft carriers in combat, and another examines uses for aircraft carriers in non-combatant national security or to help the country recover from a terrorist attack or natural disaster. The two research groups laid out the conditions under which aircraft carriers were used in the past and how they were used, and then looked at the circumstances in which U.S. aircraft carriers would be deployed for non-traditional uses over the next 20 or 30 years. The team looked at 12 combat or non-combat scenarios that the U.S. aircraft carrier fleet might encounter in the future. For each scenario, RAND analyzed the missions the U.S. might assign to the carriers and assessed whether the current fleet is up to the task or need. Improvements are evaluated and the tactical and technical applications required to make such improvements are estimated. The Rand Corporation made five suggestions for the U.S. Navy's aircraft carriers in terms of future combat and non-combat missions, such as increasing aircraft carrier modularity, strengthening aircraft carrier detection capabilities and vitality, and increasing shipboard medical equipment.",

The competition is organized by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the International Unmanned Systems Alliance Foundation. In the competition,  students  built their own  unmanned surface boat  and needed to navigate independently to complete a series of water challenges. Project personnel from the Ship Systems and Engineering Research Branch of the Naval Warfare and Weapons Division of the U.S. Naval Research Agency said that each challenge in the competition simulated an actual maritime mission and tested the engineering of  unmanned craft design and autonomous features, while helping students develop the engineering skills needed to conduct future naval research efforts. Teams participating in the competition need to complete two required homework and five tasks. Each task requires  unmanned boat  to complete independently without human intervention. The required homework is to pass the  test  of the power, speed, navigation and basic detection capabilities of each  unmanned boat  to verify the design quality. The five tasks are to demonstrate the autonomous capabilities of the  unmanned submarine , including obstacle avoidance, autonomous parking, acoustic signal positioning, deployment, recovery, communication with the unmanned underwater vehicle, and return to the dock. Georgia Tech is this year's winner, with a $10,000 prize. Recently, the U.S. Navy has carried out a large number of unmanned system projects, including emergency comprehensive life-saving ropes, anti-submarine continuous tracking unmanned boats, unmanned boat swarms, low-cost drone swarms, etc. These unmanned autonomous technologies will provide stronger support for future operations from coastal surveillance to water rescue, from surface warfare to port security, special operations and other operations.",

From September 28 to October 2,  U.S. Coast Guard and  Bureau of Ship Inspection jointly supervised the implementation of the acceptance  sea trial , to check the Vichy for faults to ensure it meets contract requirements before delivery.  The Ship Inspection Bureau  spoke highly of the Vichy's sea trial performance. Among the 3174 inspection items, only 3 items had problems and needed to be corrected before delivery. It is expected that the Vichy will be delivered in early November, crew training and equipment testing will begin in December, and it will officially enter service on May 7, 2010.  The U.S. Coast Guard  stated that the Vichy has absorbed the experience of the first national security frigate USS Bertholf, so it has performed well in sea trials. During builder's sea trials and acceptance sea trials, engineers discovered design issues with the Bertholf's hull and sliding stern door. The Bertholf was finally delivered on May 8, 2009.",

The technology is based on BMW's method of manufacturing shock absorbers from carbon fiber. Through this technology, the fuselage will automatically wind and braid carbon fiber, while another carbon fiber wire is wrapped around a specific metal structure to measure the diameter of the fuselage.  The fuselage structure  rotates at a certain speed to provide continuous fiber placement. This system uses one-way programming technology developed by the EADS Innovation Working Group. The body includes two bobbin systems, one of which uses carbon fiber roving, while the other uses glass/polyester filament. The polyester will break down as the part cures. The system was built at the Composites Technology Center, located near Airbus' Stade plant in Germany. The first  structure  was manufactured in December 2008 and is now undergoing product  testing  and process optimization. SGL Group says the system will soon be used to create real aircraft structures.",

This step allows the spacecraft to throttle precisely and land at a smooth, controlled speed.  NASA  collaborated with  Pratt & Whitney  to demonstrate this control capability of the  engine , designed to enable the probe to land on the moon or other planets. A reliable and stable descent engine helps. Recently, the  Universal Scalable Cryogenic Engine  completed the last series of ignition  tests  on a 6804-kilogram-thrust cryogenic rocket prototype, increasing its capability by 35% compared with previous tests. This series of tests demonstrated the operation of the  engine  from a power thrust range of 104% to 5.9% of power. This is equivalent to an unprecedented 17.6:1 deep throttling capability, which means that this low-temperature engine can quickly control throttling. Another important goal of the test series is to test a closed-loop control system using a mixture ratio component that controls the amount of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen entering the combustion chamber. The system also monitors combustion pressure feedback during throttling. Precise control of propellant and thrust could reduce the amount of fuel needed to land future spacecraft, thereby lowering launch costs and launch quality. Landing a spacecraft on an unknown surface is a bit like driving at night, full of unpredictable challenges. When the spacecraft encounters rocks or large rocks before landing, it must throttle quickly and avoid accurately to avoid damaging the spacecraft.",

It has accumulated more than 17,600 test hours and met all ISR requirements, including reliability, durability and performance. Another milestone was the successful installation of the first production propulsion system on the  production F-35 fighter jet . \"We celebrate this achievement together with the employees of the F-35 Joint Program Office and  Lockheed Martin ,\" said Warren Poli, president of Pratt & Whitney Military Engines. Every day and every milestone, the F135 engine proves its unprecedented performance, maturity and reliability. This achievement brings us one step closer to delivering this game-changing aircraft to the U.S. military and other allies. The F135 engine has undergone a large number of ground and flight tests to prove that it can meet the different needs of the army, navy and air force. It currently remains the only engine in the  F-35  flight test program.",

The operating procedures of the staff are all correct, but the military will check it against the reference materials delivered along with the missiles by the United States and France. The  test  was conducted at an air force base in  southern Taiwan  , details of which were kept secret from the outset. In January, the media reported on a live-fire exercise in which 19 missiles were launched, 6 of which missed their target or failed to detonate successfully. On March 23, the person in charge of Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense reported this issue to the government, believing that it was caused by a combination of human factors and mechanical failure. At the same time, he also promised to conduct a comprehensive inspection. But this was not enough to convince the largest opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party. They believe that the occurrence of the second failure proves that military training cannot fundamentally solve the problem, and the person in charge of the Ministry of National Defense still needs to explain this issue. Previous failures did not arouse too much criticism from Ma Ying-jeou, but he only urged the military to step up training.",

TS100V  Designed specifically for the growing needs of ISR, it can support the data acquisition needs of the latest high-performance photoelectric/infrared sensors. The system acquires data from HD-SDI sensors and supports resolutions and transfer rates of 720p60 and 1080p30. Once the data is acquired, the video can be played back on the onboard processor and tactical data link system.  TS100V  is capable of recording approximately 14 hours of high-definition video and decoding the associated audio using H.264/MPEG4. A key factor to consider when selecting a system is cost.  TS100V  Uses low-cost, compact flash solid-state memory, allowing for post-mission replay and debriefing using traditional PCs and existing video player software.  TS100V  The small size, low weight and minimal power requirements make it an ideal data acquisition solution for airborne, vehicle-mounted, shipboard and ground-mounted ISR applications.  TS100V  incorporates some future programmable features, including transport stream KLV metadata multiplexing and other SSD storage options.  Ampex Corporation  will provide an operational demonstration of the  TS100V  at the AUVSI Unmanned Systems North America Conference in Washington, D.C., August 16-19.",

Instead, it blindly emphasizes the establishment of multi-dimensional cooperation between allies and non-allies. Many allies have been expecting the  United States to provide a white paper and provide evidence proving that  Osama bin Laden planned and organized this terrorist attack so that Allied countries can launch attacks against it. However, Paul Wolfowitz did not prepare such evidence at all, but only listed some details about how to investigate terrorist activities and possible military actions. But he stressed that NATO allies will follow him at all levels of operations, including providing intelligence, political support, providing airspace, logistical support and  U.S.  -led military operations. \"If we need collective action, we will ask for it,\" he said. A NATO official said they had high expectations before the meeting but now appear to be disappointed. Paul Wolfowitz also used other diplomatic rhetoric to describe this as the need to handle it carefully, and that military strikes may be used, but they are not the most important factor in this operation. However, this is in sharp contrast to its tough stance after being attacked and its vow to fight the terrorists to the end and quickly deploy military forces.",

If an agreement is reached,  Ferranti  will use its low-visibility landing system to upgrade the signal data converter of the existing system so that it can display three-dimensional projection images. Pilots will be able to select and survey landing sites through a series of ground information transmitted to the helmet-mounted display through the LVL system. The upgraded system can also display machine side information and altitude/speed deviation information when other visual components fail. According to reports, the  LVL system  is connected to the helicopter's inertial global positioning system equipment and radar altimeter, and extracts digital terrain height from a map database.

After the exhibition, the aircraft will go to Cumbernauld Airport near Edinburgh for flight testing of the Seaspray5000E electronic scanning radar. This high-wing, light twin-engine aircraft integrates advanced mission systems, AESA radar, advanced electro-optical large format high-resolution systems, AIS ship identification systems and Indra's ISIS mission system into an airborne surveillance system suitable for The acquisition and operating costs for operations along 150 miles of coastline are unmatched. The characteristics of the AESA radar and the integration of infrared cameras in the electro-optical system make the platform particularly suitable for marine environment monitoring. The airborne surveillance system is linked to the mission control center on the ground through advanced dedicated radio links or satellites, allowing it to complete system operations from the ground control center for real-time monitoring, and system operators can stay on the ground to perform tasks.",

This device can reduce drag by about 0.3%, which can save operators a lot of fuel. The installation is on display in the Innovation Center in the  EADS  showroom. Weighing only 100 grams, the device can be installed at the leading edge root of each slat and reattach the airflow to the airfoil. Martin Muir, a research engineer in the  EADS  Innovation Engineering Department who helped develop the device, said that it only needs to wait for the chief engineer's order before it can be tested on an A330 or A340, so the device can be launched into the sky immediately. . Muir said this drag-reducing technology was conceived by Professor Michael Gaster, a well-known aerodynamicist at Queen Mary University in London in the 1960s, but computers capable of designing such shapes did not become available until recently. Another key factor in enabling this technology is the manufacturing method of the additional layers, which allows hundreds of such devices to be fabricated at unusually low cost.  EADS  uses titanium powder to create the device, which is beneficial for both weight reduction and corrosion resistance. The technology concept has been proven in wind tunnel testing and will then be installed on a test aircraft, using strain gauges to accurately measure how much drag can be reduced under flight conditions.",

A spokesman for the Brazilian Navy said that the design of the nuclear reactor for the  submarine  has been completed with the assistance of France, but the construction of the reactor will take place in Brazil at a later date. At the Brazilian Navy booth at the International Defense Exhibition, the Brazilian Navy exhibited two different designs of its own nuclear submarines. The first design plan comes from the Naval Technology Center in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This plan divides the submarine into seven segments, with a pressurized water stack in the middle of the submarine, and eight mine launch tubes located at the front of the submarine. In the second design, there are only two torpedo launch tubes at the front of the submarine, but there are six missile vertical launch tubes. The nuclear submarine of the second option has a displacement of 4,000 tons, a length of 100 meters, and a diameter of 9.8 meters. The Brazilian Navy proposed a submarine construction project called PROSUB.  Nuclear-powered submarines  are also part of this project. Brazil and France also signed a submarine construction contract with a total price of US$4.25 billion in 2008. In addition to  nuclear-powered submarines , the PROSUB project also includes the procurement of four conventionally powered submarines.

What will change in the next 40 years? The world has become digital, so equipment upgrades need to change. They need to become more automated. An aircraft may only be upgraded 1 or 2 times in its life cycle, but the avionics system will be upgraded at the same time. It may be necessary to upgrade 10 times during the period. As threats evolve, there will be a need for continued improvements in sensors, surveillance systems and situational awareness capabilities for all types of military aircraft platforms. This is the key to the development of future integrated avionics systems, which can significantly reduce costs, logistics, and training expenses. Open architecture is an important foundation for rapid capability improvement. Northrop Grumman pointed out that the digital cockpit developed for the UH-60V uses a next-generation avionics system architecture that is compatible with the FACE standard and supports off-the-shelf software and hardware integration. This plug-and-play capability also reduces system integration and upgrade risks. and fees.",

As 15 aircraft formed into three five-machine wedges flying over Tiananmen Square in sequence, the  early warning and command aircraft echelon  was honored to be reviewed by the motherland and the people on the morning of the 1st.  The early warning command aircraft echelon  consists of  Kongjing-500, Kongjing-200 early warning aircraft  and Yun-8 command aircraft as the leader aircraft, respectively escorted by 4 J-11B fighters. Early warning command is called the central link of the information-based joint operations system and is an important means to enhance low-altitude and ultra-low-altitude early warning detection and air command and guidance capabilities.  2009  During the 60th National Day military parade, our army's  early warning aircraft  made its first public  appearance  . In recent years, the construction of our military's early warning and command capabilities has entered a fast lane, and combat effectiveness has transformed from information support to main battle force, expanded from inland and coastal waters to plateau and open seas, and transformed from basic availability to the core of the system. The early warning and command aircraft flew from the air radar station to the air command post, becoming a veritable clairvoyant in the sky and a military tent in the sky. The J-11B fighter responsible for the escort mission is my country's third-generation heavy-duty, supersonic, all-weather fighter. It has multiple combat functions such as beyond visual range air combat, close combat and ground attack. It is mainly used to seize air supremacy and carry out air defense. combat tasks.",

The U.S. military is developing a  sensor  that could counter a nuclear missile from space and target it with a laser during its ascent. It is expected that in 2021, the technology of using space lasers to defeat missiles will come in handy. Richard Matlock, executive officer of advanced technology programs at the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, believes that the transition from ground-based systems to the expansion of space-based systems in the next few years is very important. Matlock believes that the United States needs a more granular system, and it is best to use space to detect countries that carry out first nuclear strikes. This would allow the United States to target nuclear missiles in the boost phase seconds after launch.  The U.S. Missile Defense Agency plans to conduct the first  interception test in  2019, and major U.S. defense contractors have announced plans to develop space-based defensive countermeasures guided weapons. The program can defeat incoming missiles carrying nuclear weapons, making it easier to protect U.S. forces from a first nuclear strike. The US Air Force Times reported that the Air Force has decided to invest US$6.6 billion in the next six years to protect US satellites. In 2016, it will spend US$10 billion on public and secret projects for space operations.",

A  B-1B  from Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, fired two Lockheed Martin production LRASMs over Point Mugu Maritime Range, California. After launch, the two missiles passed through all planned waypoints, switched to mid-course guidance, and used missile-borne sensor information to fly to moving targets on the sea. Subsequently, the two LRASMs actively identified the intended target and successfully hit it. LRASM is based on the extended-range joint standoff air-to-surface missile design. It is a precision-guided, standoff anti-ship missile that meets the operational needs of the U.S. Air Force and Navy in challenging environments. David Helsel, LRASM program director of Lockheed Martin's Missiles and Fire Control Division, said: The success of the second dual LRASM test is of far-reaching significance. As LRASM moves toward early operational deployment by the U.S. Air Force and Navy, the weapon system continues to demonstrate key capabilities required by combat forces. LRASM applies advanced technologies that reduce reliance on remote intelligence/surveillance/reconnaissance platforms, network connectivity and GPS navigation to identify and destroy designated targets within the enemy fleet. With the enhanced ability to identify targets and implement tactical attacks at longer distances, LRASM will ensure that the U.S. military opens up channels for high seas operations.",

The operational test of the M270A1 project is scheduled to be completed in May 2001. The purpose of the demonstration test is to demonstrate the strength and stability of the integrated software of the  enhanced M270A1 multiple rocket launcher system . Three  M270A1  launchers were used during the reliability demonstration trials, which included a list of emergency mission events and increased the number and frequency of simulated launch missions. Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control said: In a tactical environment, we conducted 322 successful digital launch missions using a series of multiple rocket launcher munitions. Soldiers simulated the launch of standard M26 rockets, M26A1 extended-range projectiles and ATACMS projectiles. During the trial, the  M270A1 's software and hardware worked perfectly from start to finish.  M270A1  adopts an improved fire control system and a navigation and positioning system embedded with a global positioning system.  M270A1  has a friendly open architecture including a fast processor with plug and play functionality. The new launcher incorporates improved launcher mechanics to increase responsiveness and durability, which the company says reduces the time required to aim and reload. In a typical launch mission, the  M270A1  fires 6 times faster than the M270, and the reload time is reduced by about 30%.",

After the visit, Senator Cornyn said that it is obvious that drones play an important role in protecting homeland security, and Congress should increase investment in this area, especially adding more drones for security patrols at borders and offshore waters. Senator Judd Gregg, who shares the same sentiments as Senator Cornyn, also said last month that US$2 billion would be allocated for border security purposes from the US$68 billion in additional military funds requested by the Bush administration.",

This move is a U.S. response to tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Captain Jeffrey of the USS Blue Ridge said that the three-day visit was mainly to emphasize the importance of regional security cooperation. This visit had been planned long before the North Korean missile crisis. After the Blue Ridge docked at the Huangpu River, he told reporters that only through this kind of cooperation can member states in the Asia-Pacific region enjoy the peace and stability they desire. An official U.S. spokesman said there are signs that  North Korea's  Taepodong 2 ballistic missile may have been filled with fuel and is about to undergo a  test launch. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo said it would pose a threat to regional security. Recently, the U.S. military invited a Chinese delegation to observe the Valiant Shield naval exercise held in the western Pacific this month. According to Xinhua News Agency, Chinese representatives were deeply impressed by the quality of the exercise. Washington is putting pressure on China to give U.S. troops more opportunities to return visits, participate in Chinese military exercises and visit Chinese military bases. In his speech, the captain of the USS Blue Ridge expressed the hope that his ship would be able to visit more other ports during its future trip to China - there are more than 1,000 sailors and sailors on board.",

The missile has a range of at least 80 miles and is designed to counter similar missiles that China has introduced from Russia.  Taiwan  displayed the  Xiongfeng 3 missile in a  military parade held  last year. It can be seen as a hint to the mainland that Taiwan already has weapons for self-defense. Beijing has repeatedly warned  Taiwan  that the mainland would invade if it declared formal independence.

The official also hinted that in order to prevent North Korea from conducting  nuclear weapons and missiles  transactions with other countries or international terrorist organizations, the United States has made preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction its top priority. Japan's position is that it does not accept North Korea possessing nuclear weapons. The official said that the United States handles the problem differently, showing a posture of paying more attention to non-proliferation. At the same time, he said that it must strive to achieve a  nuclear-free  North Korea. The current improvement in U.S.-North Korea relations has attracted much attention due to former U.S. President Clinton's visit to North Korea. If the United States changes its policy at this time and changes the focus of its policy toward North Korea from  nuclear  to preventing  nuclear  proliferation, Japan and other countries may be excluded. Regarding  North Korea which conducted its second  nuclear   test in  May, the United States on the one hand claimed that it would not allow it to maintain nuclear weapons; On the one hand, financial sanctions and other blockade methods are used to prevent North Korea from carrying out  nuclear proliferation. Japanese diplomats pointed out to senior U.S. officials that the U.S. posture gives the impression that it is willing to refrain from participating in nuclear proliferation. It is reported that senior US officials also expressed their desire to promote bilateral dialogue between the United States and North Korea within the framework of the Six-Party Talks, and said that consultations between Japan and North Korea should also be conducted within the Six-Party Talks. The Obama administration believes that North Korea has not developed a  nuclear missile  that can reach the United States and is therefore not a direct threat. White House spokesman Gibbs also emphasized that the biggest concern is North Korea's proliferation of  nuclear weapons and missiles  abroad.",

The U.S. Army  pays special attention to mature electro-optical imaging technology, which can provide a series of continuous still frame color image sets from the lowest viewing angle of the unpressurized load bay of a manned aircraft to monitor the ground at an altitude of 3048~6096 meters. This type of camera should be able to sample at a ground sampling distance of no more than 1.2~1.8 meters at an altitude of 3048 meters, and the cross-domain viewing angle of the  camera system  should be at least 28 degrees. In addition, the  camera  should provide geolocation metadata accurate to within 30 meters. Army officials want the  cameras  to automatically correct color balance, including real-time autofocus, automatically compensate for changes in temperature, pressure and flight altitude, to ensure consistent color between missions and between cameras.  The camera  should provide fully automatic exposure, requiring no external operation, and be able to store all acquired images for a 4-hour mission.  Cameras  should have mature strapdown installation technology to overcome the passive vibration of the aircraft.

There are currently more than 40 satellites in orbit using the A2100 platform, and the total on-orbit service time exceeds 400 years. \"We have successfully delivered missions to our U.S. government users, and the A2100 platform provides very reliable, flexible and proven capabilities, all at an affordable cost for our users,\" said Lockheed Martin Space Systems' deputy executive chairman. According to other media reports, the United States has not disclosed the user of the  CLIO satellite . The satellite is likely to be developed based on the commercial A2100 platform, but its purpose is not yet clear. It is speculated that this satellite is a follow-up mission to the PAN satellite launched in 2009.",

Diehl Corporation  said it used an IRIS-T air-to-air missile launched from a light truck and is currently supplying the missile to seven customers in Europe. The missile equipped with an infrared seeker has the ability to lock after launch and can receive data from the Saab Giraffe AMB air defense radar, which can monitor an airspace of 100 kilometers long and 20 kilometers high, and can simultaneously track 150 targets. Even in surface-launched mode, the combat range of the solid-fuel-propelled IRIS-T missile exceeds 10 kilometers. Vertical launch coupled with a very large missile homing angle can ensure 360-degree air defense. The excellent dynamics of the missile reduce combat blind spots to less than a few hundred meters. The field launch test verified the functional characteristics of the  IRIS-TSLS air defense system  based on the Saab Giraffe radar and integrated command and control system. In another project, the  DiehlBGT company  is currently developing the  IRIS-TSL medium-range surface-to-air system  to meet the needs of the German Air Force.

CDASTDP will develop an architecture that can easily integrate different types of sensors and effectors to meet the needs of a certain platform.  The company will develop a flexible open architecture that uses standardized interfaces and common programming methods to utilize various sensors and effectors installed on the platform to achieve coordinated and flexible response to threats. ability. This approach has been proven in the UK's Apache helicopters, integrating DAS controllers into the HIDAS system. Following the successful completion of this demonstration, the CDAS team is preparing for a flight  test in  September 2011, where the  CDAS system will be installed on a on a Bobcat helicopter to demonstrate improved platform survivability.",

Shi Technology Company is responsible, and cloud computing company VMware is also involved in some research and development work. The new generation command and control system will be used on all active alert-class and avant-garde class submarines, as well as alert-class submarines that have not yet entered service and next-generation nuclear submarines, ensuring compatibility of the entire fleet. The command and control system will enable British submarines to adapt more quickly to changing mission requirements, making operations safer and more effective.",

Previously, the certificate was revoked because two  JASSM  failed to meet operational requirements. . Subsequently,  JASSM  received attention, and the US Air Force planned to mature this weapon through a series of improvements.

Protection is not only durable and low-cost, but also has good maintainability.  Lockheed Martin  stated that the armor can also be applied to tactical vehicles in urban street fighting environments, and can effectively protect against multiple projectiles or explosion shock waves following armor-piercing sniper rifle fire. In this ballistic test demonstration, the armor of this protection system successfully protected against armor-piercing projectiles and fragmentation threats while weighing less than half of the current homogeneous steel armor with the same protective effect. In addition, during the test, the protection system armor also resisted four consecutive attacks from 7.62mm armor-piercing projectiles. At present,  Lockheed Martin  has briefly reported the system to the US Marine Corps. If it can be approved for equipment testing, the test results are expected to be available later in 2006.",

    "doctext": "Recently,  Raytheon Company  and the U.S. Army reached an agreement on a contract for the development and demonstration of a networked sensor system for joint land attack cruise missile defense.  Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems  developed  JLENS  to provide long-term, wide-area cruise missile defense capabilities while having stronger communications capabilities.  JLENS  will also provide situational awareness information to battlefield commanders. The information can detect and track incoming cruise missiles beyond visual range and provide adequate warning for air defense systems to engage and destroy the threat. Each  JLENS  includes a long-range surveillance radar and high-performance fire control radar, and is linked to large aircraft through ground processing stations. According to the schedule requirements, the system  test  started in  2010  and the entire plan was completed in 2012. The person in charge of the company said that  JLENS  is the key for the Army to adopt a system-of-system solution to deal with cruise missiles. It uses sensor networking to provide support for various weapons and provides beyond visual range threat detection and combat capabilities. . In addition to providing powerful cruise missile defense capabilities, the  JLENS system  is capable of tracking surface moving targets and boost phase tactical ballistic missiles, and can send target data to various weapon systems and platforms across the military services.",

The Shadow TUAS system's onboard laser pointer illuminates the target with a laser beam so that the missile can accurately track it. A total of three missiles were launched during the test: one was launched from a ground platform, and the other two were launched from Apache helicopters by locking the target before launch and locking the target after launch. All missiles hit their respective targets, verifying the accuracy of the system. According to the person in charge of the AAI unmanned aerial system project, using the airborne laser pointer on the TUAS, friendly combatants can complete the task of indicating the target without entering the dangerous area and staying away from the target. According to the plan, after this live-fire test, AAI's original products will be transferred to a low-speed production stage; during this period, the laser pointer will be produced at full speed and installed on the already delivered  shadow system . Currently, the Shadow TUAS system is mainly in service with the U.S. military and Marine Corps, with a cumulative flight time of 35,000 hours, most of which were used to support the Iraqi Freedom and Permanent Freedom military operations.",

Artillery  will soon improve its early warning capabilities for high ballistic weapons. This is due to the  new Raz radar system  which is expected to enter service in 2010. The radar can detect mortar shells fired into Israel. Thanks to the development of this new technology, the Israel Defense Forces will be able to provide early warning capabilities of high-ballistic rocket or missile attacks from Gaza. Major Goldring said:  The new system  can detect farther missiles, and the  radar  can deal with the threat of several missiles at the same time. The system can also be tracked simultaneously with other systems, such as drones and aviation control systems. The radar can also communicate with ground troops in real time. It contains a control system that transmits information across sea, land and air ranges to keep troops updated. Over the past few days, early models of the  Raz Radar System  completed  testing  and proved very successful. During the test, the  radar  successfully detected ballistic weapons fired into Israel. Today, Artillery uses the Nurit radar system, which allows them to detect missiles including Qigler, Qassam and Katyusha launched towards Israel. Mortar shells are currently the most terrifying weapon fired at Israel from Gaza, and the  Raz radar system  is the most targeted response equipment.",

After the South Korean military sent a warning communication, the ship returned to North Korea. However, 47 minutes later, at around 11:30, another North Korean guard ship crossed 2.4 kilometers across the Northern Limit Line again. The South Korean Navy issued another warning, but the guard ship continued southward, so the South Korean military fired two warning shots.

India complains that although they purchase standard parts for the Indian Air Force's MiG-21 fleet, the accident rate of this aircraft remains high. Andrei Belyaninov, a Russian official in charge of arms exports, said in Moscow on August 27 that India\u2019s high aircraft accident rate is mainly because it has been purchasing some second-hand MiG parts and equipment from Ukraine, Uzbekistan and other former Soviet republics. In fact, these parts have already been disuse. He also revealed that in the past ten years,  more than 220 Soviet aircraft  had  crashed  due to inferior parts. However, a spokesman for the Indian Air Force countered that India has conducted strict quality and safety inspections on imported MiG series aircraft parts, and all of them have passed the safety and quality certification of the exporting country. At the same time, it is not that India does not want to purchase MiG aircraft parts directly from the MiG factory in Russia, but that in the past eight years, the export of these parts has been deemed illegal by the Russian government. India also admitted that aging aircraft and poor maintenance are also one of the reasons for the high accident rate.",

's plan. The Russian navy also angrily refuted claims that the  submarine  was sunk by a missile that missed during a Russian military exercise. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Klibanov said that the cabinet will soon issue a formal order authorizing an action team to salvage the  Kursk . According to Russian media reports, Klibanov said: Neither the president nor the government has revised the decision made earlier to salvage the  Kursk  this summer. The Russian government will pay part of the cost of the action team, which is estimated to be US$70 million, and the remainder will be raised by an international fundraising group based in Belgium. The plan was to use a crane to lift the  Kursk  and then tow it back to the port of Murmansk by a giant barge. The salvage operation is expected to be completed by August. The government has not concluded the cause of the accident, saying only that the  submarine  explosion may have been caused by an internal malfunction, a collision with a foreign submarine or a World War II-era mine. Most Russian and foreign experts believe the most likely cause was an explosion of a drill torpedo. Some Russian media also reported that some believe the  Kursk  was sunk by a cruise missile launched by the cruiser Peter the Great during a naval exercise. British newspapers quoted an unnamed Russian admiral as saying the same thing. In response, a Russian Navy spokesman said: This is purely fabricated and not worthy of comment.",

Recent  testing  in a harsh launch environment also validated the robustness of the  laser semi-active seeker . In addition, the GPS/laser semi-active composite guidance mode can also be applied to 155mm and 127mm naval gun shells to give them the ability to attack moving targets on land and sea.

Russian President Vladimir Putin recently suggested that conventional military force will soon play an equal role as nuclear weapons in resisting foreign invasion.

Countries such as Russia and India are developing their own hypersonic strike weapons. Trotsky said the Missile Defense Agency hopes to upgrade THAAD to have a larger booster and an enhanced upper stage. He pointed out that work on THAAD's extended-range version actually began 12 to 18 months ago. JD Hammond, director of command and control battle management systems at Lockheed, said that  Russia, North Korea and Iran continue to conduct  ballistic missile flight  tests, Defeating U.S. missile defenses is its sole purpose. Hammond revealed that Lockheed is working on software that integrates data collected from space and ground sensors, whether it is infrared or radio frequency data, to work with advanced sensors to deal with specific threats. Doug Graham, vice president of strategic missile defense systems at Lockheed, said, \"We need to always stay ahead of the curve so that our systems remain strong against a full range of threats.\"",

In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee's Aircraft Subcommittee, he explained that the Air Force is working hard to control the cost of the bomber program and that cost is a key bid requirement. LaPlante said the development phase of the project will be a cost-plus contract, while the production phase will be a fixed-price contract. He said: The first aircraft to roll off the assembly line will be priced at a fixed price. In past remarks, LaPlante echoed Pentagon acquisition and logistics director Frank Kendall's statement that fixed-price contracts should be used only after the product is thoroughly understood. What is clear is that the Air Force believes the cost of the  LRSB  will be fully understood by the end of the development phase. In an interview with Air Force Magazine in August last year, LaPlante said that  LRSB  would not make a selection based solely on drawings, but would need to evaluate different technical samples and prototypes, implying   Scaled-down demonstrator or proof-of-concept aircraft has been  tested. He also said that industry will likely need to invest a significant portion of its own capital to ensure that manufacturing technology reaches maturity. The U.S. Air Force said it plans to award the project contract in June this year. LaPLante said there have been no changes to the project since 2010, and the aircraft unit price target of 550 million U.S. dollars in 2010 can still be met.",

It can quickly strike time-sensitive targets at long distances and is extremely difficult to intercept.  Raytheon Company  Dr. Tom Bussing, Vice President of Advanced Missile Systems, said that hypersonics is a new frontier in missile design and development.  Hypersonic missiles  will face serious aerodynamic heating problems, and their internal electronic equipment must be tightly protected, but at the same time, the weight cannot be increased, otherwise the flight speed and guidance will be affected.  Raytheon  is developing advanced materials for use in thermal shields to protect missile-borne electronics. In addition, the guidance and control of missiles at high speeds is also a big problem. Thanks to decades of experience in the development of advanced guided weapon systems,  Raytheon  is very confident in solving this problem.  Hypersonic missiles  will not replace current weapons, but will complement the US military's missile lineup.  Raytheon  plans to conduct flight  tests  of  hypersonic missiles  in the next 2-4 years.

The Navy's undersecretary of science, technology, research and development and acquisition said the program's role will be discussed with the Department of Defense again this fall.  The Navy  hopes to issue a project call for proposals and conduct a large number of  prototype   tests  after the Ministry of Defense signs off on the investment project review. In addition to the  Navy  and the Department of Defense, the U.S. Congress also participated in the UCLASS project needs analysis.  The Navy  and the Department of Defense want the program to focus more on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, while Congress wants a strong strike capability. Currently, the ULASS project has been delayed for three years due to the investment project review of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. If the United States\u2019 final decision is to position ULASS to combat unmanned systems, the  Navy will also re-define the project before awarding the contract. Sort out relevant design, investment and technical resources. There are four competing units in the UCLASS project, including Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. All four companies have currently made initial technology investments in the project. In August 2013, the  U.S. Navy  awarded $15 million contracts to each company to conduct the initial design of the UCLASS program.",

The Washington Post reports that a new secret assessment conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency has moved forward by two years the time it believes that  North Korea  could use nuclear weapons to attack northern U.S. cities.  North Korea's   recent   missile   test launches  suggest faster-than-expected progress and prompted the U.S. review . On July 25, the House Armed Services Committee secretly briefed all members on the development of North Korea's  intercontinental ballistic missiles . The Office of National Intelligence, which oversees all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, declined to comment on any changes to the secret assessment.",

Company initially upgraded and  tested  the  BlockI software  in  2017, improving the ability to detect enemy defense systems and Moving target capability. The missile is currently in service with the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and the Italian Air Force will also achieve initial operational capability in 2018.  The use of BlockI software can improve the ability of the United States and its allies to attack enemy air defense systems. Its ultimate goal is to protect combatants and ensure that land-based and sea-based advanced anti-radiation missiles can quickly, safely, and Accurately target and destroy targets while keeping your own forces safe. The Advanced Anti-Radiation Missile is a supersonic, air-launched tactical missile that is an upgrade to the AGM-88 high-speed anti-radiation missile and can quickly strike against conventional and advanced ground and maritime air defense systems. The missile uses GPS/inertial navigation system guidance and millimeter wave guidance modes.",

He pointed out: Our arsenal now has strategic bomber Tu-160, operational tactical missile system Iskander,  Sarmat missile system, S-400 air defense system, intercontinental ballistic missile, equipment anti- Ships, missiles, Zircon missiles, nuclear-powered cruisers, ballistic missile canoes. In addition, he also emphasized that the Syrian war showed that future wars will involve the air and space fields. Rifles and machine guns can no longer counterattack modern equipment. Therefore, it is necessary to develop forward long-range interception aviation systems, new missiles, strike drones, etc. In the new stage, Russia will develop high-tech precision-guided weapons and strategic nuclear forces.  The Deputy Minister of the Russian Ministry of Defense disclosed to the media earlier that the  first test of the latest  Sarmat missile is planned to be  at the end of 2017  proceed. Earlier news from the defense industry disclosed to the media that the new supersonic missile Zircon reached a flight speed of Mach 8 during the test. It has also been revealed that Zircon is undergoing testing and, after passing it, will be equipped on the Peter the Great and Admiral Nakhimov heavy nuclear missile cruisers.",

It plans to develop a  hypersonic aircraft with a flight speed of Mach 5 or above by the end of 2020. The successor of the Blackbird SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft, it performs high-speed strike and reconnaissance missions. The demonstrator will adopt a delta-wing twin-tail waverider structure and a turbine-based combined cycle propulsion system, in which a conventional turbine engine and a dual-mode scramjet engine are configured in parallel on the left and right, sharing an inlet and nozzle. If this plan is selected as a full-scale aircraft plan, the development work will be completed in two phases: the first phase will develop a concept demonstrator aircraft similar in size to the F-16 fighter jet, using a single engine, and conduct  flight tests ; The second phase is to develop a combat aircraft with a size similar to the SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft, 32.6 meters long, and using two engines.",

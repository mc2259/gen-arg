 OR MISSILES , WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT . WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURES THAT ARE GIVING RESULTS . WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCE THE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL LANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE , IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA . THANK GOD , [ WORDS INDISTINCT ]      [ REPORTER ] DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THE FMLN ? DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPS TOWARD A DIALOGUE ? [ PONCE ] YES , I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TO TALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS . I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE A POSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD . HOWEVER , IN THE MILITARY FIELD , WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US IN AN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES , THE ARMED FORCES IS REPLYING , AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY . WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEAT THE FMLN . BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS , WE HAVE INFLICTED 1,902 DEAD , 1,209 WOUNDED , AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTED AND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES . WE HAVE CONFISCATED A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS . I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES : 25 ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7 'S -- 915 RIFLES , 12 CARBINES , 11 SHOTGUNS , 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS , 49 MORTARS , 45 MACHINEGUNS , 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS , 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS , 23 RADIOS , AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES . I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITH SUPPPORT FROM ABROAD . IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL . I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEEN ABANDONED , WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS .

 A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN , AS WELL AS IN CHALATENANGO . THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS . THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW . [ REPORTER ] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS A LEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE , WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES AND ALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS . THE LEAFLET URGES SALVADORAN PATRIOTS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND , THEIR PROPERTIES , AND LIVES . IT ALSO SAYS THAT IF NECESSARY , TERRORISTS MUST BE KILLED , AS WELL AS THEIR INTERNATIONALIST ALLIES . WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS LEAFLET ? IS IT NOT AN INVITATION TO KILL FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY ?

WE WILL ENGAGE IN A VERY PRETTY DEMOCRATIC PLAY WITH REGARD TO THE NEXT GOVERNMENT . WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN BUILDING NEW COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY .

PRESS AGENCY REPORTS NOTE THAT THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN THE CAPITAL CITY , AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE EXPECTING [ CHANGES THOUGHT ] HERE IS A NEWS AGENCY REPORT WHICH SAYS THAT EARLY THIS MORNING , LESS SHOOTING WAS HEARD BECAUSE APPARENTLY EACH SIDE HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR POSITION . THAT IS WHAT SOME PRESS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING . WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN . THERE ARE MANY VEHICLES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR . THAT IS THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR , WHERE OUR FIGHTERS IN ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE NOW RECEIVING THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTIFYING THEMSELVES IN NEIGHBORHOODS . WE CALL ON THE SAN SALVADORAN YOUTHS TO GO OUT TONIGHT TO COOPERATE WITH THE FMLN FIGHTERS . MAKE THE ASSASSINS OF MSGR ROMERO PAY DEARLY FOR EVERY STEP THEY TAKE AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN SALVADOR CITY . IT HAS BEEN 24 , 25 , NEARLY 26 HOURS SINCE THE FMLN FIGHTERS ESTABLISHED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR IN VIEW OF THE REGIME 'S INCOMPETENCE . THE REGIME HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IT IS INCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION , AS IT HAS HAD TO DECREE A STATE OF SIEGE THAT BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 12 NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR . ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT 'S WEAKNESS IS THE GAG PLACED ON THE MEDIA . THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITS NEWSCASTS . WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO NEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR ? WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING ? THIS IS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING ; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER . THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID , IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY . COMRADE FIGHTERS : WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU ; THIS IS IN THE BAG . YOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS SAID . COMRADES : KEEP IT UP , KEEP AN OPEN EYE , KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE AS YOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW , SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE , RECEIVE THEIR COOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR .

THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES , DISORDER WAS RAMPANT , AND , IN MANY CASES , WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY . MOREOVER , THE NATION 'S PUBLIC FINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED .
